		<p>At a recent conference of international educators (AIEA &#8211; http://www.aieaworld.org/), representatives from VT, University of Basel and the Swiss Embassy in Washington DC served on a panel on the topic of global graduate education.  The focus of the discussion was on the Preparing the Future Professoriate Global Perspectives program and the U.S. &#8211; Swiss partnership.  After we described the program, the use of the term &#8220;global&#8221; was questioned due to the fact that our visits were limited to selected countries within continental Europe (e.g. France, Switzerland, Italy, Germany) or Chile.</p>
<p>The point raised by an audience member was a good one and prompted me to reflect on the term &#8220;global&#8221;.  While it is true the VT global perspectives program includes visits to selected universities and countries only, I would argue that the program provides a first hand experience that helps us to acknowledge differences around the world and embrace a perspective beyond our own country of origin.  The discussions in GRAD 5104 Preparing the Future Professoriate and brief presentations by international students provide a glimpse into higher education in various countries around the world.  The monthly seminars of the Global Perspectives group prior to departure provide the opportunity for more intentional focus on selected universities and countries.  Interactions among the participants enrich our understandings of each other in that not all of the VT participants are U.S citizens and not all University of Basel participants are Swiss.   We learn from each other about national perspectives, language and cultural differences and much more.  While &#8220;global&#8221; might signify the world, the experiences of the Global Perspectives program can plant the seeds and open our eyes and ears to greater understanding of our shared global world.</p>


		<p>Within the last two weeks, I have had the pleasure of interacting with multiple groupings of individuals who have or will participate in the Preparing the Future Professoriate: Global Perspectives program.  The initial meeting of the 2012 Global Perspectives group was held and we began the process of preparing for our May visit.  The PFP Chile &#8217;12 group met to debrief and reflect upon our January visit to Chile.  The weekly Global Perspectives lunch gathering was held and I was able to attend.  And most recently, I shared the draft itinerary with my colleagues who will participate in the first ever Global Perspectives program for graduate deans this July.  The pervasive sentiment across these groups is genuine excitement about learning more about the global academic world and reflecting about the significant impact upon one&#8217;s professional and personal lives.  The global perspectives program is one of the many ways through which we can and will transform graduate education.</p>


		<p>Graduate education has long focused on depth in the disciplines.  Academic disciplines have provided a system for organizing scholarship through academically accepted set of methodologies, professional journals and professional societies.  Disciplines tend to have a critical mass of scholars and educate students in the cultural norms of the discipline.  They have served and will continue to serve higher education well but more is needed.</p>
<p>With strong disciplinary foundations, we must now move and actively embrace and engage more in interdisciplinary graduate education.  Due in part to the inherent complexity of nature and society, very interesting and challenging research questions can be found at the interface between and among disciplines &#8211; these will require an interdisciplinary perspective.  This  leads scholars and graduate students to explore problems and research questions that are not confined to a single discipline and require collaborative endeavors. National agencies (e.g. <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/">NSF</a>,<a href="http://www.nih.gov/"> NIH</a>) have called for more interdisciplinary efforts and provided funding opportunities such as the Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (<a href="http://www.igert.org/">IGERT</a>) programs.</p>
<p>This brings me to the topic of depth or breadth and beyond.  Arguments are frequently put forward that graduate education should focus on depth of knowledge and thus, we must maintain a disciplinary focus and focus on the disciplines. Along with this argument, it is often acknowledged that although interdisciplinary graduate education does provide valued breadth, it lacks the depth.  I&#8217;ve worked with interdisciplinary graduate education for the past 20 years and would argue that interdisciplinary research not only requires but can achieve both depth and breadth as well as integration for success.</p>
<p>In my recent musings about interdisciplinary graduate education and research, I have come to visualize those with the depth of training and education in the discipline as I-educated individuals, those with the depth and breadth of training and education plus the ability to work across disciplinary lines at T-educated individuals, and those individuals with breadth and depth of education and training in more than one discipline and the ability to integrate knowledge across disciplines as Pi (π)-educated individuals. Through this lens, knowledge seems to be grounded in and emanate from the disciplines and then integrated across boundaries.  These are the scholars and scientists who will be able to serve as the adaptive innovators of and for the 21st century.</p>

<div>“Universities, therefore, will have to reconsider the priorities and practices of graduate education and training in order to prepare individuals……. We argue that graduate programs must not only educate future scientists to be experts in the methods, techniques, and knowledge of their chosen disciplines but to have the broader problem-solving skills that require learning, unlearning, and relearning across disciplines.”</div>

		<p>Two great universities &#8211; the <a title="Sorbonne" href="http://www.english.paris-sorbonne.fr">Sorbonne</a> (Paris &#8211; Sorbonne University) and the <a href="http://www.unistra.fr/index.php?id=homepage">University</a> of Strasbourg.  Each has a long history and rich traditions.   Visiting each of these recently only reinforced their place in history of higher education, especially French higher education. They have stood the test of time.  And yet over the years, they have changed and there is more change to come.  I learned during the recent visit that the universities in Paris including the University of Pierre and Marie Curie (UPMC) will be engaged in merger and transformation &#8211; quite a significant change I imagine.  We will watch with great interest.   <a href="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2012/03/IMG_4493-Version-2.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="33" data-permalink="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2012/03/12/sorbonne-and-strasbourg/img_4493-version-2/" data-orig-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2012/03/IMG_4493-Version-2.jpg" data-orig-size="1893,2096" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;4.5&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon PowerShot G10&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1331039945&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;24.978&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;200&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.02&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="IMG_4493 &#8211; Version 2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2012/03/IMG_4493-Version-2-270x300.jpg" data-large-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2012/03/IMG_4493-Version-2-924x1024.jpg" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-33" src="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2012/03/IMG_4493-Version-2-270x300.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="300" srcset="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2012/03/IMG_4493-Version-2-270x300.jpg 270w , https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2012/03/IMG_4493-Version-2-924x1024.jpg 924w " sizes="(max-width: 270px) 100vw, 270px" /></a></p>
<p>These two universities will play an important role in the visits of the Global Perspectives programs organized for this summer.  In May 2012, the Future Professoriate Global Perspectives program participants will visit the University of Strasbourg as part of our visit to universities of the Upper Rhine and partners of the University of Basel.  While in Strasbourg, we will visit the campus and learn first-hand about the the University, the Doctoral Schools, and the French system of higher education.</p>

		<p>The 2012 <a href="http://www.orpheus-med.org/" target="_blank">Orpheus</a> (<strong>OR</strong>ganisation for <strong>Ph</strong>D Education in Biomedicine and Health Sciences in the <strong>EU</strong>ropean<strong> S</strong>ystem) <a title="orpheus conference" href="http://http://www.orpheus2012.org/en/" target="_blank">conference</a> was held April 19-21 in <a href="http://visitbergen.com/en/" target="_blank">Bergen</a>, Norway.  I was invited to provide a plenary keynote entitled Global Doctoral Education: Critical Conversations on Saturday.  And thus, my journey began to learn more about Orpheus the organization, the individual members of the organization and to be able to listen to their conversations about evaluation of the PhD in the biomedicine and health science in Europe.</p>
<p>Nearly 200 individuals from many countries around Europe attending &#8211; almost all of them from the Biomedicine and Health Sciences disciplines.  A few of them from the European University Association (EUA) Council on Doctoral Education (CDE) and European Commission and several from the private sector.  Doctoral students and post docs were also in attendance and had a significant input into the collective wisdom to be captured in the consensus documents produced at the end of the conference.  It was pointed out at the open session that I was the only U.S. citizen in attendance &#8211; an actually delightful experience because the focus was on Europe and I was afforded the opportunity to hear their issues, concerns, and recommendations.</p>
<p>One &#8220;hot&#8221; topic was the implementation of <a title="Standards document" href="http://www.orpheus-med.org/images/stories/documents/ORPHEUS-AMSE-WFME-standards-for-PhD-education.pdf" target="_blank">Standards for PhD Education in Biomedicine and Health Sciences in Europe</a>.  A plenary session and multiple workshops were held about the use of these standards and of course, the perspectives differed.  Some wanted standards to be externally evaluated, others thought standards were fine but should include internal evaluation (and external), and some of us thought that the &#8220;standards&#8221; should be used more as guidelines for improvement of PhD evaluation. The final consensus has not yet been published and we await the result.  I found the discussion of terminology such as standards, guidelines, and accreditation most interesting as well as the discussion of the relationship between an external evaluating body and the use of evaluation in funding doctoral students.  A fascinating example of different cultural differences and the European system at work.</p>
<p>After only a few hours of listening, I was struck by two topics that kept coming up:  significance of the <a href="http://http://www.eua.be/eua/jsp/en/upload/Salzburg_Report_final.1129817011146.pdf">Salzburg principles</a> (part of the Bologna process documents) and the support for interdisciplinary (and multidisciplinary) research.  There were many times, it appeared to me that the speakers were referencing multi but I appreciated the acknowledgement that interdisciplinary research and graduate education were important.  (This would be a theme of my presentation on Saturday).  There was even some mention of &#8220;training&#8221; of PhD students, pedagogy and the links between education and research although most of the conversations focused on research in a more traditional sense.  Given this perspective, I knew that my presentation would take a different approach and would challenge the audience to think about higher education, examine the PhD as it currently exist and encourage critical reflections about the &#8220;conversations&#8221; in which graduate schools must engage.  The critical conversations I proposed included interdisciplinarity, teaching/learning in the academy, communicating science, innovation, social media, access to and within higher education, and collaboration.  You are familiar with these topics due to our conversations in the Future Professoriate program, especially the Global Perspectives program.</p>
<p>Bergen is a world heritage city and well worth a visit.  Given its location in the Norway, the days were long already (dark at 10pm), and the weather mild (no rain for 2 days which is highly unusual for Bergen).  I enjoyed the gathering of colleagues from the biomedical fields across the European continent and know that the conversations will continue.</p>


		<p>In a recent article entitled <a href="http://www.nafsa.org/about/default.aspx?id=30005">&#8220;Global citizenship: What are we talking about and why does it matter?&#8221;</a>, Madeleine F. Green offered her reflections about global citizenship.   The electronic version of the article traveling rapidly throughout the international education communities and beyond.  There are many within community and outside international education that are wrestling with terms such as internationalization, global education and global citizenship.  The conversation has been ongoing for many years so that topic is not new but embracing a global perspective seems to be ever more critical in today&#8217;s world.</p>
<p>For many, you know that I would definitely be seen as an advocate for enabling individuals to become global citizens.  Obviously this would be most apparent in the Graduate School&#8217;s commitment to global higher education through the <a href="http:/http://graduateschool.vt.edu/graduate_school/tge/index.html">Transformative Graduate Education</a> initiative and more specifically through the <a href="http:/http://www.vtnews.vt.edu/articles/2010/09/092710-outreach-globalperspectives.html">future professoriate global perspectives</a> program.  The Global Perspectives <a href="http:/https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/globalperspectives/">blog</a> stands as a visible representation of the growing interest in &#8220;understanding global&#8221;.</p>
<p>I hope that most of the broader university community would be in agreement with Green&#8217;s statement that the world would be a better place if colleges and universities could &#8220;produce graduates with knowledge and the disposition to be global citizens&#8221;.  From my perspective, &#8220;producing graduates&#8221; would apply not just to the undergraduate experience but to graduate students as an integral component of their preparation as the future leaders, scientists, scholars, artists, and educators.  Further, it is my firm belief that university administrators should engage and encourage the faculty and staff at our colleges and universities to become more engaged with a global understanding of the world.  Although the most frequent example of global engagement is study abroad, not everyone can have this experience.  And therefore, establishing global understanding among all of the university constituencies would require that global awareness and understanding come not only from experiences abroad but also from authentic global experiences &#8220;at home&#8221;.   This would be a challenge but should be among the goals of a 21st century university.</p>
<p>In the quest toward &#8220;producing&#8221; global citizens, colleges and universities will need to envision and develop programs and opportunities (abroad and at home) that are meaningful and relevant, incorporate active participation and individual engagement, and designed intentionally toward reaching the goal of global understanding.  These programs and opportunities are critical but perhaps most important is the realization that the journey towards becoming a global citizen must begin with introspection, a greater understanding of one&#8217;s own cultural context(s) and how these influence every day life to inform ourselves as global citizens.</p>
<p>The VT Future Professoriate Program stands as an example through which the study abroad (global perspectives program) and study-at-home (GRAD 5104) portions help prepare future faculty as global citizens.  The partnership with UniBasel provides a similar experience starting in Basel and then a visit to selected universities in the US.  This year, participants from the University of Lund will join us at <a href="http://http://www.oired.vt.edu/cesa/index.htm">CESA</a> in Riva San Vitale for a global graduate education seminar.  Although as participants in the 2012 Future Professoriate global perspectives program our individual journeys began from our unique place, the journeys have begun to converge and become enriched by the shared space and common experiences on the path to greater global understanding and becoming an informed citizen of our global society.</p>

		<p>An early train from Capolago-Riva San Vitale through the Swiss Alps to Zurich.  Mostly quiet enjoying the views and lost in my thoughts about the 2012 Global Perspectives program.  A special experience which none of us wanted to end.</p>
<p>It was great to share time with colleagues from UniBasel and Lund at CESA exploring access and higher education.  The conversations will continue and not just in Blacksburg and at the Swiss Embassy.   Let&#8217;s continue the dialogue and make global higher education our shared reality. Thanks to all!</p>


		<p>A week ago today, we gathered in Zurich to begin our journey.  Since then, we have visited 7 universities varying in mission and size; one more to go.  We met with Presidents (Rectors) of three universities (University of Basel, University of Strasbourg, and University of Lugano).  We heard many presentations about the academic programs, toured labs and facilities, talked with students and administrators.  We traveled by train mostly, a few buses and walked for many kilometers on a daily basis.  We have enjoyed finely prepared meals paired with outstanding wines.  We have visited cultural sites and explored the local scenery and customs.</p>
<p>Last Wednesday, we arrived in <a href="http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riva_San_Vitale">Riva San Vitale </a>&#8211; our home for the next week.  The VT Faculty Development program participants were already in residence in Riva.  Our itineraries overlapped and thus were able to share travels and conversations.</p>
<p>Today is a holiday in Switzerland and the Santa Croce Church will open tomorrow for the first time in 2+ years.  We will visit the opening and witness a celebration of cultural heritage.  Another rich experience among many of the trip.  Still more to come.</p>

		<p>On May 8th, the last of our monthly meetings of the 2012 VT Future Professoriate: Global Perspectives program was held prior to our individual departures to Switzerland.  Although our departure dates vary, the official start of our collective experience begins at 3pm on May 20th in the lobby of Hotel St. Josef in Zurich Switzerland.</p>
<p>A couple of days later, I ran into<a href="http://archdesign.vt.edu/faculty/lucy-ferrari"> Lucy Ferrari</a> (co founder of<a href="http://www.oired.vt.edu/cesa/index.htm"> CESA</a>) in President Steger&#8217;s office on the eve of her return home to Switzerland.  She expressed excitement and pleasure that yet another Global Perspectives group would join her for dinner at her favorite restaurant overlooking Lugano and Italy &#8211; <a href="http://www.carona-tourism.ch/de/gastronomie/ristorante-san-grato.html">Ristorante San Grato</a>.</p>
<p>As the days to departure decrease, the ability to focus on the global perspectives trip increases.  Commencement(s) are done.  The Honorable Michelle Obama and Senator Mark Warner spoke at VT commencement.  The speeches were inspiring and intensity (security) great.  The students are on their way &#8211; some are traveling in Italy, some in Switzerland and others to countries beyond.  I&#8217;ll be the last to fly &#8211; and then we will meet in Zurich.</p>
<p>During the previous Global Perspectives programs (this is the 7th year), I have encouraged participants to &#8220;look&#8221; and &#8220;see&#8221; the world around them.  I have especially encouraged the observations of doors and windows which I find provide wonderful views into the culture of the places we visit.  Yes, the &#8220;doors and windows&#8221; are obvious cultural markers and can easily serve as an initial focus for viewing the world.  And yet, observations should extend well beyond simply the doors and windows as physical objects to &#8220;doors and windows&#8221; as metaphor for &#8220;seeing&#8221; to understand and appreciate the culture.  During our individual and collective global perspective experience, our lives can be enriched by opening the doors and the views provided through the windows.  Let the journey begin.</p>


		<p>The theme of the 2012 Global Graduate Education Summit is &#8220;access to and within higher education&#8221;.  [The summit is a culminating event for Virginia Tech&#8217;s Future Professoriate Global Perspectives program held in Riva San Vitale, Switzerland in partnership with University of Basel in Switzerland and University of Lund, Sweden].  What follows is a preview of my musings in preparation for the opening presentation of the summit on May 29, 2012.</p>
<p>&#8220;Access to&#8221; and &#8220;access within&#8221; means many different things and we will explore the various meanings and global trends during the Summit.  At least initially, &#8220;access to&#8221; seems to make reference those who do, those who do not and those who should be able to seek admission into a college or university.  Historically specific groupings of individuals have not been able to access higher education but there seems to be emphasis on increasing access to colleges and universities in various parts of the world.  And with the advances in technology and the digital evolution the question must be raised about access to colleges and universities in a more traditional sense of higher education vs access to higher education in the sense of advanced knowledge and understanding not necessarily housed within colleges and universities.</p>
<p>&#8220;Access within&#8221; refers to those within the academy and how they access knowledge and understanding through teaching and learning, research/scholarship and engagement within higher education.  How information is taught.  How knowledge is acquired.  How learners learn. How one accesses information within and across disciplines or not.  How research questions are developed and shared or not.  The ways in which learning, discovery and engagement are or could be connected. These are just some of the topics that will be explored in the Summit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Access&#8221; also refers to access to the scholarship and information discovered (or uncovered) within the university.  Questions here could include who has access to the scholarship currently and how the public could access the information.  Open Access? Scholarship as private good or public good?  Education as private good or public good?  And there&#8217;s more.</p>
<p>Issues of access are intriguing and complicated &#8211; exciting conversations to follow.</p>


		<p>On July 22, 2012 the Tour de Academe <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/gpgraddeans/">(Graduate Deans&#8217; Global Perspectives Program</a>) begins in Paris just as the <a href="http://www.letour.fr/us/index.html">Tour de France</a> ends.  The cyclists will ride along the Champs-Élysées to finish <a href="http://www.letour.fr/2012/TDF/COURSE/us/2000/etape_par_etape.html">Stage 20</a>.  Shortly after the Tour de France awards ceremony near the <a href="http://www.arcdetriompheparis.com/">Arc de Triomphe</a>, we will join  our hosts for the reception and dinner on the 24th floor of the University of Pierre and Marie Curie (<a href="http://www.upmc.fr/en/index.html">UPMC</a>) with a striking view of Paris including the Arc de Triomphe, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_Tower">Eiffel Tower</a> (not shown in this photo), the Louvre, and much more.</p>

<p>The 2012 Global Perspectives Program &#8211; Graduate Deans begins at 3pm (1500) at Hotel Maxim in the Latin Quarter, Paris with our first meeting of the <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/gpgraddeans/who-are-we/">graduate deans</a> who have chosen to participate in this experience.  This program is a natural extension of the Global Perspectives Program offered through Virginia Tech Graduate School and through the University of Basel.  For more information, please visit the GPP graduate deans<a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/gpgraddeans/"> blog</a>.</p>


		<p>Lukas said it.  Justin tweeted it.  We all felt it (perhaps also the audience at the Swiss Embassy).  The 2012 Global Perspectives Program (GPP) has come to &#8220;the end but the global perspectives process continues&#8221;.</p>
<p>The global seminar on &#8220;access to and within higher education&#8221; at the <a title="Swiss Embassy in Washington DC" href="http://www.eda.admin.ch/washington">Embassy of Switzerland</a> on June 15, 2012 officially ended the GPP&#8217;12 program.  The well attended event featured a keynote presentation by <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Karin-Fischer-Bio/48567/">Karin Fischer</a>, Senior Reporter for the Chronicle of Higher Education on the topic of access to higher education.  The GPP&#8217;12 participants from Virginia Tech, University of Basel and the University of Lund shared their reflections on access to and within through panel presentations and discussion with the audience.  Key <a href="https://twitter.com/?utm_campaign=kpdepauw&amp;utm_content=213447207561596928&amp;utm_medium=fb&amp;utm_source=fb#!/GPPVT">highlights</a> of conference are available via twitter.</p>
<p>During my drive back to Blacksburg, I took time to reflect upon GPP&#8217;12 and take note of the many and varied aspects of the program, the interactions with each of the participants, and the ways in which the program has once again changed our lives.  As seen through my lens, the program was indeed very successful! Thanks to all who participated, organized and contributed to the program&#8217;s success (<a href="http://internationalaffairs.unibas.ch/joint-programmes/joint-visiting-programmes/gpp/">UniBasel</a>, Embassy of Switzerland, <a href="http://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/">University of Lund</a>, <a title="VT Graduate School" href="http://graduateschool.vt.edu/">VT</a>).  I am grateful to each person because I know that one&#8217;s active engagement with the Global Perspectives program truly is making a difference and contributing to the overall success of the program.   And of course, to the process of preparing global citizens through global conversations.  Keep up the good work and let the conversations continue!</p>
<p>In July, I will lead a group of U.S. Graduate Deans on a similar <a title="Global Perspectives x 4" href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2012/02/05/global-perspectives-x-4/">global experience.</a>  Thus, the program expands and the process continues.</p>

		<p>The<a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/gpgraddeans/"> Global Perspectives Graduate Deans</a> program ended on Friday in Lugano and I traveled back to Zurich for one day prior to my return to the U.S.</p>
<p>As I walked around Zurich today, I could hear the voices of GPP alumni, I could see your faces in the crowds, and I was reminded of moments of sipping cappucino, eating bratwurst, strolling along the lake, watching the swans, buying chocolate, putting luggage on the train, walking the stairs to ETH and University of Zurich, and much much more.  Although I did stop &#8220;counting people&#8221; when the program ended, your presence was still alive in Zurich.</p>
<p>There are many stories spanning the seven years of the Global Perspectives Program including multiple programs (Switzerland, Chile, GradDeans).  These programs cut across universities, countries, languages, and more.  And they hold very fond memories indeed.  It has been my great pleasure to share these personal and professional experiences with the global perspectives program (GPPers) as well as my graduate dean colleagues. Thank you for joining me on these adventures toward greater global understanding and helping to enrich <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/globalperspectives/">global perspectives</a>.  Read, share and contribute to the blogs.  Follow us on twitter @GPPVT and @kpdepauw (and more).  Find us on Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Virginia-Tech-Graduate-School/348802603577#">(VT Graduate School</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Global-Perspectives-Programme-University-of-Basel/119816501460078">UniBasel GPP</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GlobalPerspectivesProgramVirginiaTech">GPPVT</a>).</p>

		<p>In a recent <a title="Tour de Academe – Individual pathways to a shared journey" href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2012/07/20/tour-de-academe-individual-pathways-to-a-shared-journey/">blog</a>, I wrote about our individual pathways and the <a title="Tour de Academe – Individual pathways to a shared journey" href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2012/07/20/tour-de-academe-individual-pathways-to-a-shared-journey/">Tour de Academe.</a>  On Sunday, July 22nd our individual pathways converged in Paris and our collective journey started.  And now, the week-long Graduate Deans Global Perspectives program ’12 (<a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/gpgraddeans/">GPGradDeans</a>) has come to an end.  Our last meeting was a joint gathering with <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/pfpswitzerland/">GPP Switzerland</a> alumni from Virginia Tech and <a href="http://internationalaffairs.unibas.ch/joint-programmes/joint-visiting-programmes/gpp/">University of Basel</a> at VT’s Center for European Studies and Architecture (<a href="http://www.oired.vt.edu/cesa/index.htm">CESA</a>). Rich discussions were held and insights gathered.</p>
<p>During the program, the Graduate Deans visited University of Pierre and Marie Curie (<a href="http://www.upmc.fr/en/index.html">UPMC</a>) and the historic <a href="http://www.english.paris-sorbonne.fr/the-university/">Sorbonne University</a>, the<a href="http://www.unistra.fr/index.php?id=homepage"> University of Strasbourg</a>, the <a href="http://www.unibas.ch/index.cfm?o_lang_id=2">University of Basel</a>, and the <a href="http://www.uzh.ch/index_en.html">University of Zurich</a>. We discussed graduate education and the future of higher education with Presidents (Rectors) from three universities. We learned about their versions of graduate schools (e.g., doctoral college, <a href="http://www.grc.uzh.ch/index_en.html">graduate campus</a>). We met with administrators and faculty.  And our program began with dialogue with colleagues from the European University Association (<a href="http://www.eua.be/Home.aspx">EUA</a>).  For details of our visit, see <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/gpgraddeans/index.php/itinerary/">itinerary</a> and read associated links.</p>
<p>This visit was nestled between the end of the Tour de France In Paris and the Opening Ceremonies of the 2012 Olympic Games. The weather was perfect throughout the week (Paris, Strasbourg, Basel, Zurich, Lugano) &#8211; a little hot at times but virtually no rain.  Our visits required the use of three languages beyond English: French, German (more precisely Swiss German) and Italian. The cuisine spanned countries and cultures. We traveled by plane, bus, tram, metro, train, and quite often by foot &#8211; sometimes up hill and sometimes with luggage. Lakes, mountains, rivers, plains, and terraced hills (e.g., vines) surrounded us daily.  A collective journey of shared experiences and individual reflections&#8230;.we have taken photos, blogged, and tweeted.  We had readers following our blogs and &#8220;followers&#8221; on twitter (@kpdepauw, @GPPVT and more).  We had families traveling with us who shared in our experiences on a daily basis.</p>
<p>The Global Perspectives program has touched many lives across many universities, many countries and across many years.  As a result, I believe that the Graduate Deans and GPP alumni now share in the responsibility to expand the reach and enrich the global experiences and perspectives of others.  It has been my great pleasure to share personal and professional experiences with my graduate dean colleagues.  Thank you for joining me on this adventure toward greater global understanding and enhanced global graduate education.</p>

		<p>While driving to the Roanoke airport this morning to catch my flight to Dulles and then Paris, I knew that our <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2012/06/23/tour-de-academe-tour-de-france/">Tour de Academe</a> had finally begun.  But in reality, the journey actually began some months ago as the Global Perspectives &#8211; Graduate Deans program was conceptualized, the itinerary developed and individual decisions were made to participate.  Although titled GP Graduate Deans, the individuals in this shared journey include graduate deans (of course), the organizers and hosts of our Tour de Academe visits, and the Global Perspectives Program (GPP) alumni from VT and UniBasel.</p>
<p>The individual pathways were set.  Some would bring family.  Some would travel solo.  Collectively, we would travel by car, bus, train, metro and airplane and arrive from many different places.  By now, some have already left their home place.  Many are traveling today as I am.  And some are preparing for departure in a few days to arrive for the Graduate Deans/GPP alumni event in Riva San Vitale in the Italian speaking part of Switzerland.</p>
<p>Today I could almost sense and did visualize the movement of the individuals toward our shared journey.  Different places, different times, and different pathways leading to the shared experience.  Each of us will leave our homes and work places and travel toward a common place called Paris &#8211; the Latin Quarter and the Hotel called Maxim to start our shared journey on Sunday, July 22, 2012.  This portion is the Graduate Deans journey and we will be joined by colleagues from the EUA and universities in Paris, Strasbourg, Basel, and Zurich.  They too are a part of the shared global perspective experience in that we can learn from each other as we engage to understand global higher education.  And along the way, we meet and interact with those we know and those we can only observe in the spaces in which we interact (streets of Paris, trains, restaurants and more).  We observe the culture, the cuisine, the building (windows and doors), Swiss Alps, towns, cities, lakes, and more.  These too are important components of the global experience.  The shared journey will culminate at VT&#8217;s Center for European Studies and Architecture (CESA) and will be enriched through the reflections and interactions of GPP alumni from VT and UniBasel who will travel along their unique pathways to reach our shared space.</p>
<p>The place and time are set &#8211; the program is in motion.  We await the arrival of the participants who will come and go throughout the journey.  Although this program will last but a week, but the journey toward global perspectives will continue.  As Lukas said of the <a href="http://newadventuresinhied.wordpress.com/2012/06/27/gpp-2012-the-basel-experience/">2012 GPP</a> Basel experience, the program ends but the process continues.</p>


		<p>Our flights are booked.  Hotel rooms reserved.  Restaurants prepared to share their cuisine.  Our academic and university hosts are eager to welcome us.  And of course, the Virginia Tech Center for European Studies and Architecture (CESA) is prepared for the arrival of the graduate deans and the GPP alumni.  After hundreds of emails, numerous meetings, many phone calls and lots of discussions across nearly 9 months, the plans have been finalized for the Graduate Deans Global Experience (July 22 -27) and the GPP alumni reunion (July 26-27).  Enthusiasm appears high and we are ready.  Follow our experiences through our blogs (<a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/globalperspectives/">Global Perspectives</a>, <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/gpgraddeans/">Graduate Deans</a>, or individual blogs) and follow us on twitter (@kpdepauw).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


		<p>Twice in as many weeks, an incoming graduate student asked me (and other admnistrators) what Virginia Tech&#8217;s tagline &#8220;invent the future&#8221; meant to us.  While &#8220;invent the future&#8221; can and does have multiple meanings and various interpretations, the video by Michael Marantz entitled &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDiUVS_-4_Q">the future is ours</a>&#8221; visually represents what &#8220;invent the future&#8221; means to me.</p>
<p>Michael Marantz created the video to inspire and it does.  I share Marantz&#8217;s view that the future is exciting and holds &#8220;immense&#8221; possibilities.  He challenges us to commit to possibilities and work hard to achieve them.  Further, I believe that his message has particular relevance for graduate education today, especially at a university with a tagline of &#8220;invent the future&#8221;.  For graduate students are indeed the future scholars, teachers, leaders, artists, entrepreneurs and more.  Their innovations and imaginations will continue well into the 21st century. They will help solve the grand challenges facing a global society and they will serve society (in keeping with VT&#8217;s motto <em>ut prosim</em>).  Graduate students independently and often in collaboration with others (faculty, staff and undergraduates) can and will &#8220;invent the future&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Invent the future&#8221; has been VT&#8217;s tagline for many years now and has helped to frame the university&#8217;s agenda.  Invent the future served recently as the foundation upon which the work of the Task Force on Instructional Technology: VT 2020 was designed.  In its <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/inventthefuture2020/">report</a>, the Task Force articulated its vision of the possible and next steps for technology at Virginia Tech.  The <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/inventthefuture2020/">blog</a> format allows for readers to engage with its critical reflections and commentary, informative narratives and perspectives, and of course links to timely videos and relevant materials available on the internet.  This report and others provided  the initial backdrop to the planning process for the university.  In its commitment to a &#8220;progressive agenda&#8221;, Virginia Tech recently prepared <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/vtstrategic/">A Plan for a New Horizon</a> Envisioning Virginia Tech 2012-2018.  The path forward to inventing the future is articulated in the plan and incorporates growth and expansion of graduate education at VT among its foci.  Graduate education is a critical component for the future of Virginia Tech.</p>
<p>Graduate education is about discovering and advancing knowledge and preparing for life and work as citizens in a globally diverse world. Graduate education is about innovation and creativity; it is about exploring possibilities and embracing change.  It is about knowing that the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDiUVS_-4_Q">future is ours</a>, truly.</p>


		<p>In higher education, we are taught to find meaning and to make sense of &#8220;our world&#8221;.  We work with data (although described differently by different disciplines).  We analyze and synthesize information.  We look for patterns &#8211; we look for trends.  We reconcile differences.  We identify the obvious and even sometimes we are encouraged to look beyond the immediate and the apparent to that which is unobvious.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Images and visuals are a part of our everyday lives.  Sometimes, they are ubiquitous; so much so that we might no longer see the obvious let alone the unobvious.  One visual that comes to mind is the FedEx logo.  The FedEx logo has become a relatively common sight.  It appears on packages, trucks, offices, and websites.  It comes in different sizes, shapes and colors.  And so you ask, why am I writing about FedEx?  (This is not a product endorsement but it does provide a good example).   Brief background.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><img src="http://www.logodesignlove.com/images/negative/fedex-logo-design.jpg" alt="FedEx logo design" width="147" height="72" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left">I heard Daniel Pink, bestselling author of <a href="http://www.danpink.com/books/whole-new-mind"><em>A Whole New Mind</em></a> and <a href="http://www.danpink.com/books/drive"><em>Drive</em>, </a>speak at an annual meeting of the Council of Graduate Schools and would shortly thereafter invite him to VT as the 2006 Distinguished Graduate School Speaker.   Pink argued convincingly that we have entered the &#8220;conceptual age&#8221; in which the &#8220;whole mind&#8221; is needed to excel in today&#8217;s society.  His more recent work shares some &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc">surprising</a>&#8221; insights into what truly motivates us.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">There&#8217;s much to learn from Pink&#8217;s work but a simple story about his son&#8217;s observation gives opportunity for reflection about the importance of that which we might not be able to see.  In his presentations, Daniel Pink often shares a story about his son viewing the FedEx truck and describing it as &#8220;the truck with the arrow on it&#8221;.  In this case, a child&#8217;s view reveals that which is obvious to him but not necessarily so obvious to others.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><img src="http://blog.fedex.designcdt.com/sites/all/themes/fedex/logo.png" alt="FedEx Home" width="134" height="51" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left">It is easy to see the obvious (the words FedEx) but until encouraged to do so, we might not see the &#8220;arrow&#8221; (space between the E and the x).   As readers, we often tend to see and focus on the words and attend less so on the visual representation that appears in the <a href="http://xfinity.comcast.net/slideshow/finance-hiddenlogomeanings/fedex/">&#8220;white&#8221; space</a>.  There are many other examples but two are included here.  In the examples below, one can definitely see what is meant to be obvious but the unobvious &#8211; the Bronx skyline and the outline of the Australian continent &#8211; requires greater attention to the visuals.</p>

<p>Our challenge is to have the unobvious become as real as the obvious.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


		<p>For the fourth time this year, I has the wonderful opportunity to visit UniBasel regarding the Global Perspectives program.  The &#8220;Input Seminar&#8221; as the beginning of the UniBasel GPP&#8217;12, the VTGPP &#8217;12 visit to UniBasel, the Graduate Deans Global Perspectives visit in July and the November GPP &#8217;12 Alumni event.   It feels so comfortable being in Switzerland and Basel.</p>
<p>The Alumni event focused on <a href="http://www.internationalaffairs.unibas.ch/gpp">Careers paths in academia: How well do we select?</a>  In attendance were GPP participants from all three years of the UniBasel program.  What a delight to see the alumni and to catch up with their lives &#8211; degrees finished, post doc positions, new jobs in academia and graduate studies in progress.  The visit enforced the desire to keep in touch with all Global Perspectives program participants &#8211; VT and UniBasel.  Stay tuned for the LinkedIn alumni site to be developed soon.</p>
<p>The Global Perspectives Program has a way of changing lives.  We meet  new people from different countries and cultures.  We explore topics facing global higher education.  We learn about our own higher education systems.  We share our thoughts in writing and through presentations and ongoing dialogue.  We learn more about ourselves and our ability to help make change in the world.  It was a privilege to watch the alumni offer their reflections on &#8220;access to and within higher education&#8221;, diversity and the purpose of the university.  Thanks for sharing and thanks for being a part of GPP!  It was a good trip &#8220;back to Basel&#8221;.</p>

<p>Social responsibility is especially important for a land grant university like Virginia Tech. One of the ways in which a univerity can exercise its social responsibility is through sharing the research and scholarly endeavors of the faculty and the students, especially graduate students.  The &#8220;open access&#8221; movement is a possibility for sharing university&#8217;s research but I&#8217;ll save that discussion for another blog.  Instead, I wish to reflect about the ways in which a research land grant university like Virginia Tech can meet its responsibility to share the results of research.</p>
<p>As faculty and graduate students we have historically been educated and trained to communicate our research/scholarship to those within our discipline primarily.  We learn how to prepare powerpoint or keynote presentations.  We prepare posters and practice our 15 minute research presentations.  We practice reading and sharing our scholarly endeavors through other media.  But we have not typically been provided with opportunites to learn and therefore we are not as skilled in communicating our scholarship to others outside our discipline and especially not to the public in general.</p>
<p>Enter actor Alan Alda and &#8220;communicating science&#8221;.   On the occasion of the annual meeting of the Council of Graduate Schools in 2010, attendees had the opportunity to learn about and experience the <a href="http:/http://www.centerforcommunicatingscience.org/">Communicating Science</a> initiative offered through the <a href="http://vimeo.com/50792901">center</a> at Stony Brook University.  Many of us were in agreement that the initiative is a powerful program that helps &#8220;scientists&#8221; and scholars to develop communication skills.</p>

<p>Realizing the importance of this work, Virginia Tech has embraced &#8220;communicating science&#8221; and initiated a program here.  Within the context of the Transformative Graduate Education (TGE) initiative of the VT Graduate School, Professor Patty Raun from the Theatre Department has offered sessions within GRAD 5104 Preparing the Future Professoriate graduate course and has established a new graduate course on Communicating Science.  Through this program and others we will engage VT graduate students with the social responsibility of the university to communicate science.</p>

		<p>The global perspectives program (GPP) for 2013 has begun!   The GPP Switzerland blog is coming back to life filled with new voices, reflections and shared anticipations.  There will be more posts, tweets, and connections to come.  The VT participants are coming together and will soon be connected with UniBasel participants.</p>
<p>Fourteen individuals from Virginia Tech were selected from six colleges (Agriculture &amp; Life Sciences, Architecture &amp; Urban Studies, Engineering, Liberal Arts &amp; Human Sciences, Sciences, Veterinary Medicine).  The monthly meetings and interactions among us are well underway.  We&#8217;re getting to know each other and starting to develop a sense of the group. And of course, I&#8217;ve already fallen into my habit of counting heads (to make sure we&#8217;re all here).</p>
<p>Our itinerary filled with university visits and cultural experiences is nearly complete.  Plane tickets are being purchased; individual travel plans are created.  Hotel reservations are made.  Our meals at fine restaurants are booked &#8211; we will dine very well.  The train trips especially through the Swiss Alps are almost finalized.  Our global perspectives program is taking shape &#8211; a choreography in the making.  Keep watching and reading as the story continues and the journey unfolds.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about the World Wide Web and social media and their impact and utility in graduate schools.  Conceptually I have understood the functionality associated with Web 1.0 and 2.0 and have sought to utilize these phases for enhanced digital interaction and communication.  What follows are some of my initial musings.</p>
<p>As a 21st century institution, the VT graduate school has undergone a transition from the traditional role as an administrative office to ‘a place and space for graduate education.’  Throughout the last century, graduate schools (not unlike other institutions) tended to operate as “top down” offices providing information (policy, procedures) through “static” means (catalogs, manuals) to “users” (constituencies, especially students) as the receivers of information.  Words similar to these have been used to describe the early days of the World Wide Web (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_1.0">1.0</a>) &#8211; users could only view (receive) information and not contribute to the &#8220;webpages&#8221;, users (constituencies) as consumers of content not active participants, and the information wasn&#8217;t dynamic.  Although available since 1993, the use of web technology by graduate schools began in earnest mostly in the 21<sup>st</sup> century and reflected the Web 1.0 approach of delivery to consumers.  We took what we did and delivered it electronically.</p>
<p>The onset of <a href="http://oreilly.com/pub/a/web2/archive/what-is-web-20.html">Web 2.0</a> in 2002 and the availability of interactive tools and social media ultimately challenged graduate schools (as well as universities and national associations) to examine our operations and to embrace the change which was well underway.  Web 2.0 allows for uses beyond the static delivery of content.  It allows users to generate, interact and collaborate in virtual community.  Web 2.0 tools include wikis, blogs, and numerous social networking sites.  The VT Graduate School was one of the first in the nation to move to Web 2.0 conceptually and to build interactive tools (e.g., <a href="http://graduateschool.vt.edu/graduate_catalog/">on-line catalog</a>, <a href="http://graduateschool.vt.edu/">featured graduate student</a>, <a href="http://graduateschool.vt.edu/">upcoming examinations)</a> and to embrace social media (<a href="https://secure.graduateschool.vt.edu/weblog/monthlymemo/">blogs</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/VTGradCommunity">Twitter, </a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Virginia-Tech-Graduate-School/348802603577">Facebook</a>), all of which are inter-connected on the <a href="http://graduateschool.vt.edu/">Graduate School website</a>.   These examples and the development of the virtual GLC (<a href="http://openlife01.cc.vt.edu:9500/wifi/">vGLC</a>) are still works in progress and ones that draw upon the greater interactivity of Web 2.0.</p>
<p>Today graduate schools must actively encourage sharing of information, the creation on content, and collaboration among the constituencies.  Although there is some &#8220;content to be delivered&#8221; the message and tools of Web 2.0 challenges graduate schools to think differently about what we do and how we do it and I&#8217;m not just referring to the administrative functions but the whole of the graduate education.  Using web technologies, graduate schools (2.0+) must rethink graduate education, embrace change and redefine &#8220;space and place&#8221; to include the brick and mortar of the physical space as well as the digital space and build graduate community.</p>

		<p>Recent conversations at multiple venues have prompted me to reflect on Wilhelm von Humboldt, the Doctor of Philosophy degree and the evolution of the modern research university.  First, the Swiss higher education system and the routine acknowledgement of Humboldt &#8216;s influence were discussed during the <a href="http://internationalaffairs.unibas.ch/print/joint-programmes/joint-visiting-programmes/gpp/gpp-input-seminar/">Input Seminar</a> for the UniBasel Global Perspectives Program (March 18-19, 2013).  Two days later in Dublin at the <a href="http://www.eua.be/eua-membership-and-services/Home.aspx">EUA-CDE </a>Global Forum on Doctoral Education (March 20-22), the topics of conversation included the evolution of doctoral education in Europe and the increasing emphasis on research in doctoral education (PhD).  During the last few class sessions of GRAD 5104 Preparing the Future Professoriate, our discussions focused on global higher education and several international students shared an overview of the higher education systems from their home countries.  This provided the opportunities to reflect on the historical perspective of higher education and their influences on universities around the world.  At the March meeting of the 2013 VT <a href="http://graduateschool.vt.edu/graduate_school/gpp/">Global Perspectives Program</a>, we discussed terminology and the similarities and differences to understand better the evolution of global higher education and the universities that we will visit in May.  And finally as I read through selected blog posts from <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/grad5104">GRAD 5104</a> and <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/pfpswitzerland/">GPP Switzerland</a> I pondered the themes of these &#8216;conversations&#8217; and realized the underlying but un-articulated interconnectedness of the 21st century research university, the evolution of the PhD and the influence of Humboldt.  Humboldt, the German university and the man, are frequently referenced in discussions about the university in Europe but less so in the United States although his influence is part of U.S. history as well.</p>
<p><img alt="WilhelmvonHumboldt.jpg" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/WilhelmvonHumboldt.jpg" width="194" height="236" /></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_von_Humboldt">Wilhelm von Humboldt</a> (1767-1835) was a 19th century philosopher, a Prussian diplomat, and an early &#8216;architect&#8217; of national education including the &#8216;university&#8217;.  He is well known throughout Europe as the founder of the University of Berlin in 1810. Within a relatively short period of time, the University of Berlin (Humboldt) would soon became a model for 19th century European universities and ultimately would influence the development of U.S. universities. In recognition of Humboldt&#8217;s influence in shaping the modern university, the university was renamed <a href="http://www.hu-berlin.de/">Humboldt University of Berlin </a>in 1949. The name of Humboldt reflects both Wilhelm&#8217;s contributions and those of his brother Alexander, a famous geographer and explorer.</p>
<p>Wilhelm von Humboldt espoused the view that the university should be a community of scholars and students.  In this <a href="http://www.historyandpolicy.org/papers/policy-paper-98.html#S4">&#8216;Humboldtian&#8217; university, </a>teaching and research were interconnected and vital to the work of the individual scholar.  Although important to advancement of knowledge and integral to the university&#8217;s mission, research was thought by Humboldt to be &#8216;ancillary to teaching&#8217;.  This notion persisted until the 20th century when research would finally be recognized as a &#8216;vital entity in itself&#8217; thus setting the stage for the further development and prominence of the modern research university.</p>
<p>During the recent European University Association (EUA) &#8211; Council on Doctoral Education (<a href="http://www.eua.be/cde/about-euacde.aspx">CDE</a>) <a href="https://twitter.com/euatweets/status/314736768450703361">Global Strategic Forum on Doctoral Education</a> in Dublin, the PhD was described historically as a &#8216;license to teach&#8217;.  This makes sense when one considers that the original purpose was to prepare scholars to teach in universities.  For many years, the doctoral degree required advanced scholarship but not original research.  And once Wilhelm von Humboldt entered the discussions, the strong link between teaching and research was made that would change the university.  As the value of research expanded and the desire for original research increased throughout the last century, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy">Doctor of Philosophy</a> degree changed and the PhD is recognized as a research degree worldwide.</p>
<p>The modern research university will continue to evolve and an emphasis on research will remain.  But the conversations about doctoral education must also continue about the importance of teaching and learning, the preparation for careers outside higher education, and the engagement between the university and society.  These conversations are happening within EUA-CDE regularly and will continue in the Future Professoriate graduate course (GRAD 5104) and especially the VT-UniBasel Global Perspectives Program.  I look forward to the ongoing dialogue.</p>

<p><em>First GPP at VT Center for European Studies and Architecture, Riva San Vitale, 2006.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is now May 2013 and another eve of departure has arrived.  In the past 8 years, there have been many eves of departure &#8211; nine to be exact and this will be the tenth.  Most of the departures were for the GPP experience focused primarily in <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/pfpswitzerland/">Switzerland</a>, one was for the pilot <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/pfpchile/">GPP in Chile</a>, and one was for the <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/gpgraddeans/">Global Perspectives program for graduate deans</a>.</p>
<p>So much has happened since that first departure.  What began as simply an idea, a possibility, has become a <a href="http://www.vtnews.vt.edu/articles/2010/09/092710-outreach-globalperspectives.html">reality</a>.  A partnership has been forged with the <a href="http://internationalaffairs.unibas.ch/joint-programmes/joint-visiting-programmes/gpp/">University of Basel.  </a>Graduate deans from other U.S. graduate schools are watching what we do and are developing global perspectives programs designed for their home institutions.  And I continue to consider possibilities for expanding the program.  By many measures the GPP has been a success: 120+ participants and multiple visits to universities in Switzerland, Italy, France, and Germany.  Presentations and publications.  Strong connections across universities and among academic leaders.  Alumni.  Collaborations.  And more.</p>
<p>The global perspectives program is more than study abroad although it probably falls under the category so identified by the university and described by colleagues.  It isn&#8217;t just a program, it is an experience and yes, an experience not unlike a study abroad program but yet somehow it is different.  It involves graduate students &#8211; that&#8217;s somewhat unique. The graduate students come from different disciplines &#8211; that&#8217;s unique.  The program is offered by a graduate school and led by a graduate dean &#8211; that&#8217;s definitely unique. The graduate students&#8217; projects are unrelated to their research.  We visit universities to understand more about global higher education &#8211; we meet with academic leadership, faculty and students, we visit different academic units (faculties, departments, buildings).  We contribute individually and collectively to knowledge and understanding of a shared theme &#8211; this year &#8216;university &amp; society: meeting expectations?.&#8217;  We interact across disciplinary perspectives, we reach across cultures and languages.  We learn.  We appreciate.  And we learn to appreciate.</p>
<p>GPP is also about the opportunity for participants to learn more about themselves.   And the experience can be a very personal one.  Sometimes it happens unknowingly, sometimes reluctantly and sometimes quite willingly.</p>
<p>As a part of the experience, I ask the Virginia Tech participants to keep journals and to write about their observations and personal reflections.  As I challenge myself daily, I encourage the GPPers to see new things and to see things in new ways (e.g., the <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2012/05/14/on-the-eve-of-departure/">doors and windows</a>) and to see the <a title="Seeing the unobvious: Fed Ex and other visuals" href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2012/10/24/seeing-the-unobvious-fed-ex-and-other-visuals/">unobvious</a>.</p>
<p>Once again I am on the eve of departure and looking forward to another wonderful shared experience and an individual journey.</p>


		<p>The summer solstice occurred on the same day as the final event of the 2013 Global Perspectives Program (GPP).  Summer solstice &#8211; the longest day of the year- is a celebration of (day)light and this year in particular of solar energy and Switzerland.</p>
<p>On Friday June 21st, the Swiss Embassy in Washington DC once again opened its doors to host the 2013 Global Perspectives Conference on Preparing Future Academic Leaders.  The theme this year was &#8220;University and society: Meeting expectations?&#8221;.  VT GPP program and UniBasel GPP participants served as panelists and discussion leaders for the intriguing dialogue focused on the expectations of the university, society and students and raising more questions than answers about the purpose of a university, the value of an education and the future of higher education.<a href="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2013/06/IMG_6623.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="671" data-permalink="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2013/06/24/summer-solstice-solar-impulse-and-swiss-embassy/img_6623/" data-orig-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2013/06/IMG_6623.jpg" data-orig-size="3456,2592" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon PowerShot G10&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1371824727&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;6.1&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;200&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.016666666666667&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="IMG_6623" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2013/06/IMG_6623-300x225.jpg" data-large-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2013/06/IMG_6623-1024x768.jpg" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-671" alt="IMG_6623" src="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2013/06/IMG_6623-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>

<p>The evening before, the Swiss Ambassador Manuel Sager <a href="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2013/06/IMG_6579.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="674" data-permalink="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2013/06/24/summer-solstice-solar-impulse-and-swiss-embassy/img_6579/" data-orig-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2013/06/IMG_6579.jpg" data-orig-size="3456,2592" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;4.5&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon PowerShot G10&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1371762891&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;30.5&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;400&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.125&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="IMG_6579" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2013/06/IMG_6579-300x225.jpg" data-large-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2013/06/IMG_6579-1024x768.jpg" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-674" alt="IMG_6579" src="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2013/06/IMG_6579-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a>hosted a reception at the Air &amp; Space Museum (Smithsonian) to celebrate the success of the<a href="http://www.solarimpulse.com/"> Solar Impulse</a> project and the <a href="http://www.solarimpulse.com/en/airplane/">plane</a> the size of a 747 flown across the U.S using only solar energy.  The pilots, Andre and Bertrand, received <a href="http://www.solarimpulse.com/en/">2013  Spirit Award </a>from Charles A. and Anne Morrow Lindbergh  Foundation.</p>
<p>At the same time of our events were underway in Washington, a group of graduate deans were engaged in discussions of global graduate education in Germany as part of the DAAD study tour.  One of these deans (Nancy Marcus, FSU) was a participant in the <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/gpgraddeans/">2012 graduate deans global perspectives</a> program offered by K. DePauw.  To read more about the Germany study tour and the graduate deans program, please read the <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/globalperspectives/">Global Perspectives blog</a> into which these posts flow.</p>
<p>With inspiration and some sadness, the GPP&#8217;13 experience has ended but happily the participants have entered into the next phase &#8211; as GPP alumni.  The GPP manual and papers will be written and available <a href="http://internationalaffairs.unibas.ch/joint-programmes/joint-visiting-programmes/gpp/">electronically</a>.  I anticipate that the conversations to continue via twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/gppvt">gppvt</a>, #gpp13, @GPPUniBasel ), facebook (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/GlobalPerspectivesProgramVirginiaTech">GPPVT Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Global-Perspectives-Programme-University-of-Basel/119816501460078">UniBasel</a>), LinkedIn (GPP alumni), blogs, google + and more.  Our lives have been enriched by the GPP experiences and we continue to grow as global scholars and colleagues.</p>
<p>Thanks all for another wonderful adventure &#8211; a quest for sure!</p>


		<p>A week has passed since our adventure called global perspectives program began in Zurich.  We have traveled by plane, train, bus, tram, and foot on our wonderful journey. Our university visits have been completed with the final two completed on Monday &#8211; <a href="http://www.usi.ch/en/index.htm">USI</a> and <a href="http://www.supsi.ch/home_en.html">SUPSI</a>.</p>
<p>We have blogged, tweeted, and posted on FaceBook.  We have briefed, debriefed, chatted and debated on the train, over meals, in the garden and beyond.  The VT GPP&#8217;13 could talk (and some probably do) into the wee hours of the night.</p>
<p>And now we await the arrival of our colleagues from the University of Basel GPP&#8217;13 program.  The theme of our global seminar is &#8220;Universities and Society: Meeting expectations?&#8221;  The dialogue will undoubtedly be rich and informative.  The public version will be shared at the Embassy of Switzerland in Washington, DC on June 19, 2013.</p>


		<p>One of the highlights of the Global Perspectives Program is the opportunity to meet and engage in active dialogue with the presidents (rectors) of selected universities:  President Prof. Dr. Andreas Fischer of the University of Zurich, Rector Prof. Dr. Antonio Loprieno of the University of Basel, President Prof. Dr. M. Alain Beretz of the University of Strasbourg and President Piero Martinoli, University of Lugano (Università della Svizzera italiana or USI).  The conversations were informative about the future of global higher education.  The individuals are quite inspiring and very accessible.</p>

<p>These individuals have graciously greeted the GPP participants and the Global Perspectives Graduate Deans programs throughout their tenure as President.  We have benefited from their expertise and willingness to spend time with us!</p>
</div>


		<p>The language that we use is important especially the words and what they imply.  We know this and we can cite many different examples.  I will offer only one perspective that resulted from my readings about faculty in higher education recently.  Not surprisingly, I regularly read the <a href="http://chronicle.com/section/Home/5">Chronicle of Higher Education</a>, <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/">Inside Higher Education</a> and other similar venues about higher education.  My comments which follow are not a criticism of these publications but should be viewed as a commentary about how we in the academy continue to use familiar words and phrases that while accurately portraying a current situation do therefore perpetuate these notions as if they are &#8220;fact&#8221; and can&#8217;t be changed in the future. Two examples follow.</p>
<p>The first of two phrases that I read and hear colleagues use is the &#8220;two body problem&#8221;.  These words are commonly used to describe the situation in which two individuals (e.g., spouses or partners), or at least one of these individuals, seek faculty positions in higher education.  Since the 1980s, words like spousal hire, partner accommodation, and more recently dual career hires have been used.  An underlying assumption was that this was a &#8220;challenge&#8221; or &#8220;problem&#8221;.  I agree (and have argued favorably on numerous occasions) that indeed higher education needed to become aware of and proactively address the fact that increasingly so couples desire career opportunities for each individual and therefore, often two faculty positions. This phenomenon has increased over time and has become a reality facing higher education.  And thus rather than call it &#8220;the two body problem&#8221; which immediately casts the situation negatively as a problem, perhaps we could use language that reflects a positive attitude and encourages action.  The message sent and received is very different if we change &#8220;problem&#8221; to &#8220;opportunity&#8221;. <em> Inside Higher Education</em> has made positive strides forward in this arena through the featuring &#8220;dual career&#8221; couples (reflecting via photos a full range of diversity) and their opportunities to <a href="http:/http://careers.insidehighered.com/search">seek dual careers</a> as evident on their <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/">website</a>.  This sends a message that two careers are possible rather than a problem.</p>
<p>The second phrase and one that is relatively new is &#8220;<a href="http://chronicle.com/article/The-Baby-Penalty/140813/">the baby penalty</a>&#8220;.  Dr. Mason (former Graduate Dean at UC Berkeley and current faculty member) and her colleagues have studied and authored a recent book in an attempt to answer the question of whether or not babies matter.  Their research shows that babies do matter and make a difference in the lives of female academics.  Honestly, I don&#8217;t find this surprising because I think intuitively we know that having babies and raising children does impact one&#8217;s lives and more so for females than the males.   While the data do support a &#8220;negative&#8221; impact upon the female faculty member in a traditional sense of academy, the data are also a reflection of the way higher education is currently structured and not the way that it could be.  Families and babies should not be referred to as a &#8220;penalty&#8221;.  In the <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/The-Baby-Penalty/140813/">Chronicle of Higher Education article</a>, Mason stated that it is time to &#8220;&#8230; demand family policies that will at least give them a fighting chance to have both a successful career and babies.&#8221;  University leaders could use the data to insist that higher education actually make structural changes and more fully embrace families and work-life balance in our colleges and universities.  This truly is an opportunity and perhaps a mandate for change.  Let&#8217;s begin by modifying our words because language is important.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


		<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Kennedy">Donald Kennedy</a>, President Emeritus of Stanford University wrote about the responsibilities of faculty in his book entitled <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=1BOUGMw_mgwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Academic Duty</a> (1997).  Kennedy wrote that &#8220;<a href="http://www.aaup.org/issues/academic-freedom">academic freedom</a>&#8221; was well known but less so &#8220;academic duty&#8221; due to the &#8220;relatively uncodified&#8221; (p. vii) understanding of faculty work. He argued that faculty work included the following duties: to teach, to mentor, to serve the university, to discover, to publish, to tell the truth, to reach beyond the walls, and to change. Today, we would likely propose that the work of faculty has expanded to include additional roles including grant writing, fundraising, public relations, global perspective, civility, and building inclusive communities to name a few.</p>
<p>As I reflect on these duties, I think we could agree that many of the academic duties (e.g., to teach, to discover, to publish, to serve, to mentor) are well known and accepted among the responsibilities of faculty.  The degree to which these and other duties are evident in the lives of the faculty do vary some depending upon the type of university and type of faculty position but they are what we can expect when hired as a tenure track faculty member.  But they do represent the core of faculty work.</p>
<p>Two of the duties deserve additional comment &#8211; &#8220;to tell the truth&#8221; and &#8220;to change&#8221;. The academic duty of &#8220;to tell the truth&#8221; has become increasingly more important especially in the context of almost daily reports of research misconduct, plagiarism, and other examples of lapses in professional and scholarly ethics in higher education.  The availability of entities such as the Office of Research Integrity (<a href="http://ori.dhhs.gov/">ORI</a>) with the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and official ethics guidelines and training programs through National Science Foundation (<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/rcr.jsp">NSF</a>) and National Institutes of Health (<a href="http://ethics.od.nih.gov/">NIH</a>) have brought greater attention to and scrutiny of scholars and their scholarly work and sometimes professional and even personal lives.  Online academic news sources especially the <a href="http://chronicle.com/section/Home/5">Chronicle of Higher Education</a>, <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/">Inside Higher Education</a>, <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/">World University News</a> regularly provide news and updates on cases of academic misconduct and of course, social media including twitter (e.g., <a href="https://twitter.com/HHS_ORI">ORI twitter</a>) helps disseminate information.  Professional codes of conduct and ethical guidelines exist in many academic disciplines and are often incorporated into the professional development of the future faculty.</p>
<p>&#8220;To change&#8221; is the second academic duty to be highlighted here.  It has been said that universities are slow to change and those of us who have been in higher education for some time would likely agree.  But I would argue that universities and therefore faculty have a responsibility to change, to grow and to challenge ourselves to continue to be meaningful and relevant today and for the future.  Universities are social institutions and therefore have a responsibility to society, including a global society.  Higher education has been challenged by the technological advancements and the rapid rate of change. One need only to consider the development of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web">internet</a> and the surprising speed of the <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2013/03/09/graduate-education-and-web-2-0/">transition </a>from Web 1.0 to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">2.0</a> and the most recent development of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course">MOOC </a>and its impact upon higher education. Institutions of higher learning have yet to realize the full extent of these developments. If we are open to it, MOOCs will help us understand more about learners and learning and they can challenge us to think differently about how we provide opportunities for acquiring and disseminate knowledge.  These are but two examples about how we must engage with change and prepare the faculty (and future faculty) to change and to be changed.</p>

		<p>In the early 1990s a colleague used the word &#8220;futurisktic&#8221; or at least that&#8217;s what I thought I heard. (Note: I tried to give him credit years ago but he claims not to have coined the word).  Anyway, I was intrigued by the word that cleverly combined future and risk and I quickly adopted it for use in my musings about the future and in some of my presentations and publications.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sethgodin.com/sg/">Seth Godin</a> wrote a recent <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2013/11/every-presentation-worth-doing-has-just-one-purpose.html">blog</a> in which he argued that &#8220;every presentation worth doing has just one purpose&#8221; and that is to make change happen.  According to Godin, &#8220;change, of course, opens doors, it creates possibilities and it&#8217;s fraught with danger and apparent risk.   Much easier to deny this than it is to embrace it.&#8221;  Godin&#8217;s advice seems to fit with what I identify as futurisktic.</p>
<p>As a concept, &#8220;futurisktic&#8221; implies keeping an eye to and a vision for the future with attention to the opportunities and challenges (risks) associated with progress.  Being futurisktic is about change.  It is about embracing risk as an integral aspect of change.  Risk should not be viewed as a negative but risk taking will likely force us out of our comfort zones.  By doing so, it allows us to acknowledge and embrace the meaningfulness and value of change.  I&#8217;m not arguing for change simply for change sake or simply taking risks without thought.  Being futurisktic is about pushing ourselves and pushing the limits as is so wonderfully exemplified in the video entitled <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDiUVS_-4_Q">the future is ours</a>.</p>
<p>Another example among many is the TED talk by Sir Ken Robinson about the<a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/sir_ken_robinson_bring_on_the_revolution.html"> learning revolution</a> in which he describes the need for revolution not evolution. To actively engage in transformation and to acknowledge that often what stops us from making progress is the &#8220;tyranny of common sense.&#8221;  Robinson argues for and encourages us to become active participants in the learning revolution.</p>
<p>These examples are but a few of those that illustrate futurisktic endeavors.  They provide examples of intentional, purposeful and meaningful change &#8211; growth, progress and advancement.  We live in a time of rapid change.  As we engage change, I encourage us to be futuristic in our thinking with a willingness to take risks &#8211; that is, futurisktic!</p>

		<p>When asked by <a href="http://aminotes.tumblr.com/post/4994624354/isaac-asimov-predicted-the-internet-of-today-20">Bill Moyers in April 1988</a> &#8220;can we have a revolution in learning?&#8221;, Issac Asimov responded with “Yes, I think not only that we can but that we must.&#8221;  He went on to talk about the time when &#8220;<strong>once we have computer outlets in every home, each of them hooked up to enormous libraries, where you can ask any question and be given answers, you can look up something you’re interested in knowing&#8221;. </strong> Asimov was actually talking about the internet before the internet had become a reality.  And he was talking about the need for educational reform and the need for lifelong learning, learning that was individualized, a learning revolution some 35 years ago.  His message of the late 1980s is as important today as it was then.</p>

&#8220;That’s another trouble with education as we now have it. People think of education as something that they can finish.&#8221; &#8212; Isaac Asimov<br />

<p>Did we have a learning revolution in the late 20th century?  Perhaps we could say that some progress has been made but with more needed (that&#8217;s for a longer conversation). Although there are many good things happening in learning in schools and higher education, we have yet to realize the full extent and possibilities of the learning revolution.  Sir Kenneth Robinson, in arguing for the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9LelXa3U_I">learning revolution</a> states emphatically that what is needed is a transformation from the &#8220;dogmas of the past&#8221; and the &#8220;tyranny of common sense&#8221;.  In a <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_how_to_escape_education_s_death_valley.html">2013 TED talk</a>, Robinson spoke eloquently about the three principles &#8220;crucial for the human mind to flourish&#8221;, creativity and the climate of possibility for education in the U.S.</p>
<p>Robinson and Asimov are but two of the scholars who have argued for educational reform. Although they have often focused on public school education, their messages are very compelling and therefore applicable for higher education as well.  The learning revolution can and should occur at colleges and universities in the United States and around the world.  Some examples are currently underway within the Commonwealth of Virginia including the <a href="http://www.provost.vcu.edu/viceprovosts/innovation_studentsuccess.html">Office of the Vice Provost for Learning Innovation and Student Success</a> as VCU, the Technology-enhanced Learning and OnLine Strategies (<a href="http://www.tlos.vt.edu/">TLOS</a>) at Virginia Tech, and the Transformative Graduate Education (<a href="http://graduateschool.vt.edu/Transformative-Graduate-Education">TGE</a>) initiative offered by the VT Graduate School.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s encourage our colleagues to engage our students (undergraduate, graduate), faculty and administrators in conversations about transformation and change for universities for the 21st century and to lead the learning revolution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<div>
<p>Some years ago now, a colleague of mine wrote about conditions for graduate study which not only influenced my thinking in the 1980s but still resonate today.  I have recalled these conditions and used to share them often with others especially new graduate students. But hadn&#8217;t thought much about their influence until recently when I was reflecting on the topic of this blog post.</p>
<p>William Harper (1980) wrote &#8220;Some conditions for graduate study&#8221; which was published in the academic journal entitled <em>Quest</em> (Vol. 32 Issue 2, p174).  Harper argued that there were at least four conditions for graduate study: academic quality, time to fiddle, a baggy idea of truth, and a sense of community.  The words themselves seem readily apparent in meaning and informative of that which should be a part of graduate education.</p>
<p>As a graduate dean, I&#8217;m often in a position to welcome incoming graduate students and encourage them along the journey through graduate study.  I have used words such as expect academic rigor and quality, demand excellence and to hold high expectations of oneself and others.  I have encouraged graduate students to work hard but to play as well (hopefully keeping a balance). I have been and continue to be a strong advocate for building a diverse and inclusive graduate education community.  In reflecting upon these phrases, there is a definite connection back to Harper&#8217;s writings for which I am grateful and wish to acknowledge.</p>
<p>So what about doodles?  According to Wikipedia, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doodle"><b>doodle</b></a> &#8220;is an unfocused or unconscious drawing made while a person&#8217;s attention is otherwise occupied. Doodles are simple drawings that can have concrete representational meaning or may just be abstract shapes&#8221;.  The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doodle">Wikipedia entry</a> provides interesting historical information and names of some notable doodlers.  A recent feature on <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/sunday-morning/">Sunday Morning</a> provided an entertaining and informative overview of &#8220;<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-higher-purpose-of-doodling/">the higher purpose of doodling</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>In addition to the meaning articulated in Wikipedia and visualized on CBS, doodles are defined in multiple ways.  <a href="http://doodle.com/">Doodle</a> can be used to schedule meetings or gatherings.  And even Google has its own version of doodles &#8211; <a href="http://www.google.com/doodles/about">Google Doodles &#8211;</a> doodles that are essentially re-drawings of the Google logo.</p>
<p>Just as there are multiple meanings of the word doodle, I consider &#8216;doodling&#8217; and &#8216;fiddling with ideas&#8217; as similar concepts. Even more so, the concepts underlying doodles and doodling include reflection, contemplation, and other forms of musings of one&#8217;s mind. An exciting part of graduate education is the lively and intense engagement with ideas. This can become apparent in and through our writings (including blogging) and our academic conversations ranging from the quiet moments of dialogue as well as to the noisy passionate debates.</p>
</div>
<div>For graduate education, academic quality is a must.  A sense of community (or communities) remains important for sharing space and place for graduate study in today&#8217;s social media rich global society.  Taking time to fiddle (to play and to play with ideas) remains critical to finding solutions to problems and preparation for the grand challenges of tomorrow.  Innovation and creativity must be at the core of scholarly inquiry and thereby keeping a &#8220;baggy idea of truth&#8221;.</div>
<div></div>
<div>All of us should find the &#8220;time to fiddle&#8221; with ideas and to engage with a &#8220;baggy idea of truth&#8221;.  Progress toward transformation and changes in higher education are dependent upon the musings of our minds especially as manifest through innovation and creativity.  What are your musings? your contemplations? your doodles?  Time to doodle.</div>


		<p>Most everyone would agree that social media has changed the ways in which we interact &#8211; not just in our social settings but in our professional lives as well.  Although somewhat slower initially to embrace social media, higher education institutions are now coming to realize the significance and the impact that social media has had upon learning.  The students are bringing social media with them and if we are to engage with them as faculty and administrators we must also engage with social media.</p>
<p>I believe that social media is fundamentally changing how we communicate within, about and outside of higher education.  The impact extends across the multiple missions of a university &#8211; teaching/learning, discovery/research, and engagement.  For this blog, I will reflect briefly on its influence upon one aspect of the graduate education, the completion and sharing of graduate student research.</p>
<p>Two of the time-honored traditions of earning a graduate degree especially a Ph.D. are the oral defense of one&#8217;s research and scholarly endeavors and the archiving of this work in a thesis and dissertation.  It is true that publications, presentations, performances and the like can be shared publicly prior to degree completion, graduate schools and faculty still honor the tradition of the thesis or dissertation as the embodiment of the body of work needed for earning a graduate degree. The archiving of the research is achieved commonly today through Electronic Thesis and Dissertation (ETD) processes, some hard bound copies placed on library shelves and in faculty offices, and frequently through journal publications or books.  The second tradition is the final oral defense.  Even though the oral defense is a public event in most cases, these defenses are usually designed for an internal and academic discipline specific audience especially the committee members. These traditions will likely continue into the near future although the venues, formats, and media will evolve.</p>
<p>With the advances in technology, the sharing (and archiving) of graduate student research is gradually changing.  Increasingly, graduate schools have adopted ETD processes and are exploring ways to increase interactivity, innovation and creativity. The open access movement has created multiple ways for graduate students to share their work and publish through <a href="http://www.plos.org/open-access/">open access</a> journals.</p>
<p>Perhaps the more significant change is the ways in which graduate student scholars communicate their research, with whom they share and the timing of such sharing.  Historically this sharing occurred at the end of the degree and primarily with the thesis/dissertation committee but the times have changed.  A few examples follow.</p>
<p>Communicating, communicating well and communicating with the public about graduate student research have become increasingly important. Toward this end, several examples come to mind: Communicating Science, Three Minute Thesis, and Dance Your Dissertation.  Previously I&#8217;ve written about <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2013/01/13/communicating-scholarly-endeavors/">communicating scholarly endeavors</a> including the initiative offered through the <a href="http://www.centerforcommunicatingscience.org/">Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science</a> at SUNY Stony Brook.  Similar type workshops to enhance communication about research have been and are continuing to be developed including the American Association for the Advancement of Science (<a href="http://www.aaas.org/page/communicating-science-workshops">AAAS</a>) and similar workshops through National Science Foundation (<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/events/event_summ.jsp?cntn_id=117845&amp;org=NSF">NSF</a>) and articles from National Institutes of Health (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3752169/">NIH</a>).  In addition, graduate schools and colleges are offering workshops or courses on communicating science such as the one we offer at Virginia Tech through the Transformative Graduate Education initiative (<a href="http://graduateschool.vt.edu/gs/tge">TGE</a>).</p>
<p><a href="http://threeminutethesis.org/docs/3MT-logo-brand-guidelines.pdf">Three Minute Thesis (3MT®)</a> was developed in 2008 by the University of Queensland. In brief, the 3MT is a research communication intended for public audiences in which the graduate students can use one &#8220;slide&#8221; and talk for three minutes only.  The 3MT competition has proven to be a very effective way for graduate students (master&#8217;s and doctoral students) to enhance one&#8217;s ability to communicate one&#8217;s research.  These competitions can now be found at the university, regional and national levels.</p>

<p>Sponsored by AAAS and Science magazine, the unique program entitled <a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/scientific-community/2013/11/dance-your-ph.d.-and-winner-…">Dance Your Dissertation</a> is another way in which graduate student research is made more accessible to the public.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Some additional musings about the use of social media in graduate student research.  The future likely includes: use of twitter hashtags (#) during defense for discussion beyond those in attendance, use of social media platforms for seeking funding for graduate student research (crowdsourcing), use of social media to connect with other conducting similar research, use of platforms (e.g., <a href="http://figshare.com/">figshare</a>) in the development of research and feedback about results, and more.  It should come as no surprise that these are already happening and more.  We must continue to embrace the principles underlying the earning of a graduate degree but understand and acknowledge that graduate student research process will continue to evolve.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s the discussion about originality in Kirby Ferguson&#8217;s <a href="http://everythingisaremix.info/">&#8220;Everything is a Remix&#8221;</a>.  But I&#8217;ll leave that for another time.</p>


		<p>In a quest to extend my knowledge and understanding of higher education around the world, I had the occasion to visit the National University of Singapore (<a href="http://www.nus.edu.sg/">NUS</a>) in April 2014.  A quick bus tour through the campus revealed a large, urban campus not unlike a U.S. research university filled with research facilities, academic buildings, residence halls, sport complexes, administration buildings, faculty offices and much more.</p>

<p>NUS began as a small medical college and in less than a century has become a large, vibrant complex for higher education in Singapore and in Asia.  A review of NUS&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nus.edu.sg/">website</a> further reveals the depth and breadth of the university and its importance to the region. Impressive!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then we visited the newest addition to the University &#8211; <a href="http://utown.nus.edu.sg/">University Town</a> (known as UTown).  Even more impressive!  UTown is described as &#8220;an educational hub complete with residential spaces, teaching facilities and study clusters, UTown has created a lively intellectual, social and cultural environment that distinguishes the University <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: normal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: normal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: normal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: normal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: normal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: normal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: normal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: normal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: normal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: normal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: normal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: normal">through excellence in learning and student engagement&#8221;.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>Located with UTown is the <a href="http://www.nrf.gov.sg/about-nrf/programmes/create" target="_blank">Campus for Research Excellence And Technological Enterprise (CREATE)</a>, an international research campus and innovation hub with access to students and faculty of NUS.  CREATE houses a vibrant research community with interdisciplinary research centers, technology incubators and access to Singapore corporate laboratories.</p>
<p>NUS University-Town (UTown) provided us a glimpse into higher education in the future which values innovation, sustainability and technological enhancements and actively promotes interdisciplinary educational opportunities, research experiences, and corporate and civic engagement.  Key to success seems to be its attention to and the robust efforts toward work-life integration.</p>
<p>Although smaller in scale, the efforts of the Virginia Tech Graduate School especially the Graduate Life Center (<a href="http://www.graduatelifecenter.vt.edu/">GLC</a>) and the Transformative Graduate Education (<a href="http://graduateschool.vt.edu/gs/tge">TGE</a>) initiative have followed along a similar path.  NUS UTown stands now as a model and provides excellent examples of programs and initiatives for us to consider.</p>


		<p>As is the common practice at this time of year, universities celebrate the ending of the academic year and the graduation of undergraduate and graduate students through University and Graduate Commencement ceremonies.  At the Virginia Tech <a href="http://www.unirel.vt.edu/audio_video/2014/05/051614-gradschoolcommencement.html">Graduate Commencement</a> ceremonies on May 16, 2014, the master&#8217;s and doctoral degree recipients crossed the stage to be hooded, received their diplomas and were congratulated by many.  Speeches were given, music (original composition) was played, visual reflections viewed and more.  A celebration of an ending but more importantly a new beginning.</p>
<p>To commence is to begin.  And once again, I find myself <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2013/05/22/on-the-eve-of-departure-once-again/">on the eve of departure</a> for the 9th year of the <a href="https://graduateschool.vt.edu/GPP">Global Perspectives Program</a> and ready to board the plane to Zurich. The 2014 theme is <em>Future of higher education: Preparing for change</em> which is not only timely for global discussions but also for personal &amp; professional reflections about change.</p>

<p>In the spirit of Joseph Campbell, <a href="http://www.vtnews.vt.edu/articles/2014/04/042414-president-gradspeaker.html">Claire Guthrie Gastanaga</a>, Executive Director of the American Civil Liberties Union (<a href="https://www.aclu.org/affiliate/virginia">ACLU</a>) of Virginia, in her address at the 2014 VT Graduate Commencement Ceremonies encouraged each of us to have a &#8220;courageous conscience&#8221; as we prepare for change.  She indicated that having a courageous conscience means being &#8220;a person who is actively engaged in making one&#8217;s workplace, one&#8217;s family, one&#8217;s community a better place, and a person who is not willing to compromise his or her values or integrity just to keep a job, a relationship, or a comfortable place in life&#8221;.</p>
<p>As we commence with a graduate degree from Virginia Tech or begin the journey known as GPP (Global Perspectives Program) (or both) let us experience the life that&#8217;s waiting for us!  The 2014 GPP participants will commence our collective and individual journeys at <a href="http://www.st-josef.ch/">Hotel St. Josef</a> in Zurich Switzerland at 1500 (3:00 pm) on Sunday, May 25th.</p>


		<p>For the last two weeks, the VT Global Perspectives Program (GPP) participants (@GPPVT, #gpp14) have been actively engaged in visits to selected universities in Switzerland, Italy and France. The theme for these visits was the &#8220;future of higher education: preparing for change&#8221;. Toward the end of our trip, we were joined by our GPP University of Basel colleagues at VT Center for European Studies and Architecture (CESA) in Riva San Vitale, Switzerland for a global seminar.  Lively discussions and conversations ensued.</p>
<p>Before and during the travel part of GPP, we gather information &#8211; &#8220;facts and figures&#8221;. We talk with academic administrators, faculty and students. We tour the universities &#8211; meeting rooms, buildings and &#8220;labs&#8221;.  We compare and contrast and more. We seek answers to our questions.</p>
<p>Throughout, there were some ah-ha moments, some quiet reflections and musings, shared commentary and most importantly some deep dives into the &#8220;head-spinning&#8221; information and perspectives which were shared with us. More questions and lots of them with no clear answers.  This is good because this is when we are moved out of our comfort zones and well understood contexts into a space where we become more open to hearing, seeing and perhaps understanding things differently and from another&#8217;s perspective. And this is one of the intended consequences of the Global Perspectives Program &#8211; actively seeking and gaining perspective.</p>


		<p>Many words are used to describe the changing context for higher education in the 21st century &#8211; &#8216;change&#8217; being one but more recently &#8216;disruption&#8217;, &#8216;innovation&#8217;, &#8216;global&#8217; and &#8216;learning revolution&#8217; are code for what is or should be happening in higher education.  But the use of &#8216;unruly paradox&#8217; to describe the university was new to me until recently.</p>
<p>It was actually more than a decade ago when Ben Johnson (then Chair of the Board of Trustees for Emory University) coined the term &#8220;<a href="http://news.emory.edu/stories/2013/11/er_ben_johnson_tribute/campus.html">unruly paradox</a>&#8221; in making reference to &#8220;the <a href="http://news.emory.edu/stories/2013/11/er_ben_johnson_tribute/campus.html">unrelenting swell and heave of change</a>&#8221; which is a constant in the university.  <img data-attachment-id="910" data-permalink="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2014/07/11/unruly-paradox/ben_johnson520/" data-orig-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2014/07/ben_johnson520.jpg" data-orig-size="520,347" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="ben_johnson520" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2014/07/ben_johnson520-300x200.jpg" data-large-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2014/07/ben_johnson520.jpg" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-910" src="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2014/07/ben_johnson520-150x150.jpg" alt="ben_johnson520" width="150" height="150" />In 2000, Johnson articulated that &#8220;<em>a great university is a thing of unruly paradox.  It is a place of tranquil reflection and a testing place and indeed a battleground of outrageous ideas&#8221;  </em>He continued that a university<em> &#8220;requires stability, yet is a catalyst for change. It teaches respect for boundaries, yet encourages pushing those boundaries. It is a place of self-conscious egalitarianism, yet a place of studied rank. It trains for the sacred, as well as the secular. It gleans from the past, to prepare for the future…&#8221;</em></p>
<p>How do we prepare for the future?  What will the universities look like in 10 years? How have they changed in the past 5 years?  As an &#8216;unruly paradox&#8217;, the university must manage the tensions of history, boundaries, and stability and the pushing of limits, outrageous ideas and being a catalyst for change.</p>
<p>Higher education more broadly defined must also accept the responsibility for change and adaptation. The pace of change is astonishing and doesn&#8217;t appear to be slowing down?  For example, when the class of 2014 entered in 2010, the iPad had been only recently introduced and four years later (for their commencement) there are four generations of iPads plus the iPad Air. The impact of technology and social media is significant not only in the &#8220;classroom&#8221; but throughout the university.</p>
<p>In addition to technology, there are many other factors that could be discussed here.  A critical factor I wish to highlight here revolves around access: access to higher education especially defining the student/learner, discussion of delivery modes and locations for learning as well as access to education, research, knowledge through open educational resources and open access publishing.</p>
<p>Other factors are brought to light by Drew Faust, President of Harvard University. In a <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/video/harvard-s-faust-on-financing-higher-education-6uRjoIghSKCKLWliCnx4Gw.html">recent interview</a> with <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/video/harvard-s-faust-on-financing-higher-education-6uRjoIghSKCKLWliCnx4Gw.html">Bloomberg </a>about the future and financing of higher education, she identified three major forces facing higher education: digital revolution especially its impact on learning and teaching, global context and expectations, and the breaking down of traditional disciplines boundaries. She briefly discussed MOOCs and other digital learning modalities as helping us understand more about learning and processing of information and that they must inform our teaching. Embracing a global perspective has become even more important and defining the global context and expectations more challenging. Yes, disciplines are evolving and transcending boundaries (albeit somewhat slowly at times) and moving toward the interfaces between and among disciplines and into interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary programs.</p>
<p>Change is challenge and a condition of an &#8216;unruly paradox&#8217;. Ultimately, change will impact the organizational structure as well as the functionality of higher education. Change is also an opportunity. One of our opportunities in preparing for the future is to embrace innovation and creativity within higher education and prepare not only ourselves but especially the students/learners to develop the &#8220;habits of mind to adapt to change&#8221;.  These habits will last a lifetime.</p>

		<p>The Virginia Tech Graduate School is leading an initiative to join the conversation with Connected Courses this semester.  Our efforts will include graduate students and faculty in the conversation.  Pleased to participate.</p>


		<p>This semester many of us are engaged with a national initiative entitled <a href="http://connectedcourses.net/">Connected</a> Courses. At Virginia Tech, we developed our own <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/activecolearning/connected-courses/">active co-learning</a> group of faculty and graduate students to interface with each other and <a href="http://connectedcourses.net/">ConnectedCourses</a>. And the dialogue ensued.</p>
<p>The first unit (of six) challenged us to engage with &#8220;why we need a why&#8221; and participants were asked to reflect specifically on &#8220;why we teach&#8221;.   Michael <a href="http://http://www.k-state.edu/media/mediaguide/bios/weschbio.html">Wesch</a> and his colleagues (Randy Bass, Cathy Davidson) shared some of their teaching experiences, introduced purpose driven not just content driven courses, and challenged us to contemplate &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_mcTLlG_wg">why we need a why</a>&#8220;.  They asked us to share &#8220;why I teach&#8221;.</p>
<p>As I pondered &#8220;why I teach&#8221;, my thoughts quickly moved toward questions of &#8220;why&#8221; beyond teaching as related to the future of higher education and the future professoriate. We are often taught about the 7 questions &#8211; the who, what, when, where, how, why and why not. As one who is focused more on process, I especially appreciate the why, the how and the why not.</p>
<p>In the graduate course I teach, GRAD 5104 Preparing the Future Professoriate, we have been discussing the roles and responsibilities of faculty (teaching, research, service and more) and the changing nature of higher education. As the students consider their future as faculty, they must ask themselves which university they will choose and why, the roles and responsibilities they will embrace and why, the pedagogical strategies to utilize and why, the possibilities for change and why not, and how they will engage with colleagues, students, and community.  Inasmuch as the path forward for higher education requires dynamic mostly non-linear processes and will offer some exciting opportunities, the faculty and the future faculty must innovate, create, and lead change.  The questions they ask and answer especially the &#8220;why&#8221; will inform the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


		<p>Building academic community for graduate students has been a goal of the Virginia Tech Graduate School since at least 2002.  Universities traditionally have fostered a sense of community for the undergraduate experience but often left the graduate student experience in the hands of the department, the &#8220;lab&#8221;/team, or the faculty member.  In my role as Vice President and Dean for Graduate Education, I have encouraged the VT Graduate School to embrace community as an integral part of graduate education.  In 2003, we developed an initiative called Transformative Graduate Education (<a href="http://graduateschool.vt.edu/gs/tge">TGE</a>) with a focus on preparing the<a href="http://graduateschool.vt.edu/gs/tge/fp"> future professoriate</a> (PFP).  Since then the VT Graduate School has continued to expand and enhance the graduate student experience through building academic community especially through the <a href="http://www.graduatelifecenter.vt.edu/">Graduate Life Center</a> which provides a physical &#8220;space and place&#8221; for graduate education. Now, that space and place for graduate education must naturally go beyond physical space to the digital world.</p>
<p>As the connectivity and interactivity of the web expands, so must the initiatives and opportunities for higher education to share community, networks and connections.  The <a href="http://connectedcourses.net/">Connected Courses</a> initiative provides the platform for a &#8220;collaborative community of faculty&#8221; to explore networked learning, open access and the values of the &#8220;open web&#8221;.  We determined that Connected Courses could also provide a wonderful opportunity to bring the faculty and the future faculty together in conversation about <a href="http://blogs.lt.vt.edu/activecolearning/">active co-learning at VT.</a> To expand our efforts in transforming graduate education, graduate students must be in the conversation about embracing change and to foster <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2013/11/10/futurisktic/">futurisktic </a>thinking (<a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2013/03/09/graduate-education-and-web-2-0/">web 2.0</a>, <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2014/03/03/graduate-education-and-social-media/">social media</a>).</p>
<p>The dialogue begins.  Please join us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


		<p>In my role as Vice President and Dean for Graduate School at Virginia Tech, I have thought a lot about transforming graduate education in general and more specifically about preparation in an academic area as well as preparation for career(s) after degree completion.  The graduate dean should think about these things and create opportunities and programs for graduate students to enhance their preparation for success in the career options they can pursue following degree completion. Academic area mentioned above does not mean simply discipline or department but rather encompassing departments, programs and includes multi-, inter- and transdisciplinary areas of study.  And careers refer to academic and careers outside academe and the fact that graduates should expect a lifetime of career changes.</p>
<p>Many of us in higher education often make reference to the &#8220;I&#8221; educated or the &#8220;T&#8221; educated individuals. The &#8220;I&#8221; has been used to refer to depth in the discipline and the &#8220;T&#8221; offering breadth beyond the depth within the discipline. Breadth can be understood in terms of going beyond one&#8217;s discipline moving toward multi or interdisciplinary thinking.  Breadth can also be interpreted as moving toward a more holistic education that of a well rounded person.  Although applicable to graduate education, this breadth has been associated more commonly within the undergraduate experience; education in a discipline plus educational opportunities beyond one&#8217;s major(s).</p>
<p>I have reflected on the &#8220;I&#8221; and the &#8220;T&#8221; in the context of and advocating for interdisciplinary graduate education.  In a <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2012/03/28/interdisciplinary-thinking-pi-and-adaptive-innovators/">blog </a>post entitled &#8220;interdisciplinary thinking, Pi and adaptive innovators&#8221;, I introduced the Pi symbol as a visual representation of interdisciplinary thinking and adaptive innovators.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi"><img data-attachment-id="73" data-permalink="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2012/03/28/interdisciplinary-thinking-pi-and-adaptive-innovators/images-2/" data-orig-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2012/03/images1.jpg" data-orig-size="225,225" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="images" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2012/03/images1.jpg" data-large-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2012/03/images1.jpg" class="alignnone  wp-image-73" src="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2012/03/images1-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="34" height="34" srcset="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2012/03/images1-150x150.jpg 150w , https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2012/03/images1.jpg 225w " sizes="(max-width: 34px) 100vw, 34px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi">Pi </a>is primarily understood as a mathematical constant or a Greek letter.  Much has been written about Pi in those contexts but I use it here as a symbol of and metaphor for interdisciplinarity.   As shown above, the symbol Pi includes three lines: two vertical lines and one line across the top of the two vertical lines.  Beyond the straight line, each of these lines has an additional feature at one end.</p>
<p>I find the visual compelling in its simplicity.  Interdisciplinary thinking and education requires depth in one of more disciplines of study and the ability to integrate across the disciplines.  There must be a firm foundation (wider base) grounded in the knowledge within a discipline and a strong connection (anchor, hook) into the academic field(s) of study.  The horizontal line provides the link between the academic pillars.  Specifically, this line represents the link that facilitates meaningful connections between (among) the academic areas of study, integrates knowledge and understanding across the disciplines and extends beyond the pillars of the disciplines to situate knowledge and understanding in the societal context.</p>
<p>Societal context is important.  Academic leaders need to acknowledge and confirm the underlying principle and purpose of higher education &#8220;to educate&#8221; but we must also be mindful of the need to implement programs that incorporate the knowledge, skills and abilities for success in the work place. Reports from the Council of Graduate Schools (CGS) support and encourage <a href="https://www.cgsnet.org/university-leaders-issue-statement-interdisciplinarity-graduate-education-and-research">interdisciplinary graduate education. </a>Two additional reports from Educational Testing Services (ETS) and Council of Graduate Schools (CGS)  articulate clearly the responsibility of Graduate Schools to prepare graduates for the professoriate and careers outside academe.<a href="http://www.fgereport.org/"><img data-attachment-id="1003" data-permalink="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2014/10/27/i-t-and-pi-as-metaphors-for-graduate-education/report/" data-orig-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2014/10/report.png" data-orig-size="168,216" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="report" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2014/10/report.png" data-large-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2014/10/report.png" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1003" src="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2014/10/report-150x150.png" alt="report" width="150" height="150" /></a> <a href="http://pathwaysreport.org/"><img data-attachment-id="1004" data-permalink="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2014/10/27/i-t-and-pi-as-metaphors-for-graduate-education/pathreportcover/" data-orig-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2014/10/pathreportcover.jpg" data-orig-size="181,234" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="pathreportcover" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2014/10/pathreportcover.jpg" data-large-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2014/10/pathreportcover.jpg" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1004" src="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2014/10/pathreportcover-150x150.jpg" alt="pathreportcover" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our ongoing efforts to transform graduate education (and higher education), academic leaders should continue to support &#8220;I&#8221; and &#8220;T&#8221; education and we must definitely encourage more &#8220;Pi&#8221;-educated individuals.  The universities for the 21st century need scholars who have the depth, breadth, and integrated interdisciplinary perspectives to address the complex problems facing us in 21st century.</p>


		<p>Blogging has a role in 21st century higher education including graduate education.</p>
<p>Although blogging and blogs have been around for more years, Gardner Campbell (currently <a href="http://www.provost.vcu.edu/about/office-leadership/vice-provost-for-learning-innovation-and-student-success/">Vice Provost for Learning Innovation and Student Success</a> at Virginia Commonwealth University) was on the Virginia Tech faculty and passionately advocated for the use of blogs for the undergraduate students in the VT Residential Honor&#8217;s College.<img class="alignleft" src="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2011/08/10/%7E/media/EDU/CampusTechnology/Images/2011/08/Gardner%20Campbell.ashx" alt="" width="92" height="112" /> In August 2011, he wrote that blogging could &#8220;<a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2011/08/10/how-blogging-can-catalyze-learning.aspx">catalyze learning</a>&#8221; through the framework of &#8220;narrate, curate, and share&#8221;.  His efforts inspired me as Vice President and Dean for Graduate Education to establish my own blog and to incorporate blogging in Graduate School administrative activities and more importantly as an integral part of the Transformative Graduate Education (<a href="http://graduateschool.vt.edu/gs/tge">TGE</a>) initiative. (Note: currently we are also engaged in other types of social media [e.g. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/VTGraduateSchool">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/vtgradcommunity">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/edu/school?id=162003&amp;trk=edu-up-nav-menu-home">LInkedIn</a>] but the focus here is blogging).</p>
<p>For the past several years, <img data-attachment-id="1014" data-permalink="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2014/12/17/blogging-in-graduate-education/blogging-as-pedagogy2/" data-orig-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2014/12/blogging-as-pedagogy2.jpg" data-orig-size="1024,768" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="blogging-as-pedagogy2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2014/12/blogging-as-pedagogy2-300x225.jpg" data-large-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2014/12/blogging-as-pedagogy2.jpg" class="alignleft  wp-image-1014" src="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2014/12/blogging-as-pedagogy2-150x150.jpg" alt="blogging-as-pedagogy2" width="173" height="173" />blogging has become an integral part of several graduate courses offered within the Graduate School&#8217;s Transformative Graduate Education (TGE) initiative including GRAD 5104 <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/grad5104/">Preparing the Future Professoriate</a>, GRAD 5114 Contemporary Pedagogy (<a href="https://tlos.vt.edu/gedi/">GEDI</a>), GRAD 5214 <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/diversity/">Diversity and Inclusion in a Global Society</a> and GRAD 5014 <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/grad5014/">Ethics and Scholarly Integrity</a>.  Embracing &#8220;blogging as pedagogy&#8221; in these courses, graduate students are encouraged to &#8220;reflect, read, write and share&#8221; with their colleagues on topics related to not only preparing the future professoriate but current issues facing higher education.  Although some expressed initial hesitancy to blog and were new to blogging, most of the graduate students became actively engaged with blogging.  Many commented that they enjoyed learning a new skill and found it valuable.  Indeed, blogging is an important aspect of modern learning.</p>
<p>Beyond its use in graduate courses, blogging was introduced to the faculty and graduate students associated with interdisciplinary graduate education at VT specifically through the Interdisciplinary Graduate Education program (<a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/vtige/igep-program-overview/">IGEPs)</a>.  Each IGEP has created a blog that feeds into the &#8220;<a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/vtige/">mother blog</a>&#8221; hosted on the website which provides the shared space for cross IGEP discussion.  Another example is the use of blogs with the <a href="http://graduateschool.vt.edu/GPP">Global Perspectives Program</a> organized through the VT Graduate School.  The &#8220;grandmother <a href="http://blogs.lt.vt.edu/globalperspectives/">blog</a>&#8221; for the Global Perspectives program gathers and shares blog posts from several &#8220;mother blogs&#8221; including GPP <a href="http://blogs.lt.vt.edu/pfpswitzerland/">Switzerland</a>, GPP <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/pfpchile/">Chile</a>, GPP <a href="http://blogs.lt.vt.edu/gppalumni/">alumni</a>, and from the <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/gpgraddeans/">graduate deans</a> experience.  This provides but one example of how individual blogs can feed into a common space for collective reflection on global perspectives and engage colleagues around the world.</p>
<p>Blogs are but one form of communication in today&#8217;s academic world.  In sharing and disseminating our scholarship, we have typically used publications (articles, books, exhibits and more) and presentations. Technology used in our connected world allows for other ways of sharing today.  Blogs use a different voice and often reach different audiences in different ways but represent a valuable tool for scholars and practitioners.  Graduate students as the future faculty and career professionals need to gain these skills as part of their graduate degree and preparation for the 21st century workforce.</p>


		<p>Diversity and multicultural were two of the early terms that were used to describe efforts toward increasing demographic diversity in the corporate world and higher education dating back to the 1980s.  Since then, the terminology has continued to evolve as have the efforts and activities.</p>
<p>Many of the initial efforts were focused on access to higher education by individuals of diverse backgrounds especially individuals of color.  Recruitment became a priority with less attention paid to retention and graduation although these would follow. These early efforts and initiatives were based mostly on compositional diversity.  Studies were done, data collected and analyzed. Recommendations made and strategies put forward which became common practices at colleges and universities around the United States. Chief Diversity Officers (CDO) and associated offices were established and charged to increase diversity, including efforts for faculty, staff and students.</p>
<p>In developing successful retention strategies and degree completion among students of diverse backgrounds, universities were forced to examine the university environment and how the climate (perhaps &#8216;chilly climate&#8217;) influenced not only access but more so retention, and ultimately graduation. As a result, support programs and student success offices evolved. And the language and terminology continued to evolve.</p>
<p>The terms of &#8220;inclusion&#8221; and &#8220;inclusiveness&#8221; were made prominent by the American Association of Colleges and Universities (AACU) <a href="http://www.aacu.org/programs-partnerships/making-excellence-inclusive">Inclusive Excellence</a> initiative.  Many universities would ultimately adopt this approach and the &#8220;inclusion&#8221; terminology now leads many offices and initiatives.</p>
<p>Virginia Tech adopted the AACU inclusive excellence approach which guided our most recent diversity strategic plan and led the way to our current initiative.  Since early fall 2014, Virginia Tech has embarked on a journey toward inclusivity through our &#8220;<a href="http://www.inclusive.vt.edu/">InclusiveVT</a>&#8221; initiative.  In developing the university-wide initiative, VT President Sands indicated that inclusion comes first and with inclusion diversity will follow. Through InclusiveVT, senior administrators were charged with the responsibility to propose and implement specific <a href="http://www.inclusive.vt.edu/initiatives/index.html">initiatives</a> designed to foster inclusivity throughout the university.  These efforts are focused on people, programs, and policies and are identified with the four aspects of inclusive excellence: access and success, campus climate and interior up relations, education and scholarship, and institutional infrastructure. In an attempt to increase communication and university engagement with the initiatives, activities and resources are posted on the <a href="http://www.inclusive.vt.edu/">website</a>, information shared via twitter (@inclusiveVT) and through our blog entitled <a href="http://blogs.lt.vt.edu/diversity/">diversity dialogue</a>.</p>
<p>As indicated above, there are many activities and efforts underway at Virginia Tech which can move us toward becoming &#8220;inclusiveVT&#8221;.  But the efforts and conversation must be pushed further.  If we are to become truly inclusive I believe that we must embrace inclusion as a learning community &#8211; not necessarily a Learning Community in the more formal sense but a learning community in which we (faculty, staff, students) work together with shared goals and aspirations.  In this learning community we will need to work together and collaboratively.  Not as top down or bottom up but as fellow travelers on this journey.  In this learning community, we can and must learn from each other regardless of one&#8217;s position or status.  We must be open to hearing the voices of others who are different from us and sharing openly.  As a community, we will need to understand &#8220;<a href="http://amptoons.com/blog/files/mcintosh.html">white privilege</a>&#8220;, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaggression_theory">micro aggressions</a>, and <a href="http://www.tolerance.org/activity/test-yourself-hidden-bias">unconscious bias</a> and engage in efforts to create affirming environments for all.  We should feel empowered to speak and required to listen.  In this learning community, we can and will learn.</p>
<p>The journey has begun.  Please join us and offer your reflections along the way.</p>

		<p>Words like revolution, transformation and risk-taking are not necessarily common in higher education&#8230;.until recently.  And I&#8217;m delighted to see the change.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of the i<a href="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2015/03/Use-of-the-univ.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="1082" data-permalink="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2015/04/09/risk-taking-and-higher-education-not-an-oxymoron/use-of-the-univ/" data-orig-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2015/03/Use-of-the-univ.jpg" data-orig-size="106,160" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Use of the univ" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2015/03/Use-of-the-univ.jpg" data-large-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2015/03/Use-of-the-univ.jpg" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1082" src="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2015/03/Use-of-the-univ-106x150.jpg" alt="Use of the univ" width="106" height="150" /></a>nstitutions that had been established in the Western world by 1520, 85 still exist – Catholic Church, the Parliament of the Isle of Man, of Iceland and of Great Britain, several Swiss cantons, and 70 universities. Of these, perhaps the universities have experienced the least change.&#8221; (Kerr 2001, p.115 from <em>The Uses of the University</em> originally published in 1982 by Harvard University press).</p>
<p>As indicated above and common knowledge, universities have been slow to change throughout much of history at least through the 20th century.  But the advancements in technology of the 21st century have definitely precipitated change in almost all aspects of the university.  We have seen changes in the teaching and learning mission.  Research and discovery have expanded due to the use of technology as have the ways in which we disseminate scholarship.  Innovation and entrepreneurship have become common in today&#8217;s universities.  And of course, administrative processes and communication strategies sometime bear little resemblance to the past.</p>
<p>Although change is occurring, more is needed.  Many books have been written, op-ed pieces published and reports issued about the status of higher education today.  Once such report entitled &#8220;<a href="http://www.ippr.org/publications/an-avalanche-is-coming-higher-education-and-the-revolution-ahead">An Avalanche is Coming</a>&#8221; offered the following:<a href="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2015/03/pub-avalanche-130305_10432.693d2106.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="1078" data-permalink="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2015/04/09/risk-taking-and-higher-education-not-an-oxymoron/pub-avalanche-130305_10432-693d2106/" data-orig-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2015/03/pub-avalanche-130305_10432.693d2106.jpg" data-orig-size="158,224" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="pub-avalanche-130305_10432.693d2106" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2015/03/pub-avalanche-130305_10432.693d2106.jpg" data-large-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2015/03/pub-avalanche-130305_10432.693d2106.jpg" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-1078" src="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2015/03/pub-avalanche-130305_10432.693d2106-150x150.jpg" alt="pub-avalanche-130305_10432.693d2106" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;Our belief is that deep, radical and urgent transformation is required in higher education as much as it is in the school systems.  Our fear is that, perhaps as a result of complacency, caution or anxiety, or a combination of all three, the pace of change is too slow and the nature of change too incremental&#8221; (March 2013, p. 3)</p>
<p>If the &#8220;pace of change too slow and nature too incremental&#8221;, the leadership for the 21st century universities must be willing to challenge the status quo and take risks.   We must be &#8220;<a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/?s=futurisktic">futurisktic</a>&#8220;.  In that blog (2013), I wrote:</p>
<p>&#8220;Being futurisktic is about change.  It is about embracing risk as an integral aspect of      change.  Risk should not be viewed as a negative but risk taking will likely force us out of our comfort zones.  By doing so, it allows us to acknowledge and embrace the meaningfulness and value of change&#8230;. Being futurisktic is about pushing ourselves and pushing the limits as is so wonderfully exemplified in the video entitled <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDiUVS_-4_Q">the future is ours</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>A recent example of pushing oneself and stretching beyond one&#8217;s comfort zone is the article about &#8220;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CB8QFjAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsty.presswarehouse.com%2Fsites%2Fstylus%2Fresrcs%2Fchapters%2F1579229743_otherchap.pdf&amp;ei=DLomVbubKoucsAW3y4CwCw&amp;usg=AFQjCNHk4nBQvpom11y51jrP_Mn5hrGjGw&amp;bvm=bv.90491159,d.b2w&amp;cad=rja">From safe spaces to brave spaces</a>&#8221; by Brian Arao and Kristi Clemens (2013).  The discussion of moving from &#8220;safe&#8221; to &#8220;brave&#8221; spaces has been especially pertinent to social justice and diversity. Several universities (e.g., UMBC, University of Michigan, Berkeley, UCLA, NYU) have initiated programs, dialogue and issued guidelines.  The metaphor of safe to brave should be embraced by university communities and utilized in considering futurisktic ideas and embracing change and institutional transformation.</p>
<p>I realize that change is difficult for some and especially in higher education where the culture tends to reinforce caution and the status quo.  As stated in &#8220;An Avalanche is Coming&#8221;, higher education needs transformation and individual leaders who can help lead the way.  &#8220;Ethical Ambition: Living a Life of Meaning and Worth&#8221; by Derrick Bell (2002) provides some guidance for these leaders toward this end.  He offers advise for being successful and maintaining a sense of integrity.  His message is simple in that he &#8220;urges us to liv<a href="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2015/04/Ethical-Ambition.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="1094" data-permalink="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2015/04/09/risk-taking-and-higher-education-not-an-oxymoron/ethical-ambition/" data-orig-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2015/04/Ethical-Ambition.jpg" data-orig-size="104,160" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Ethical Ambition" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2015/04/Ethical-Ambition.jpg" data-large-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2015/04/Ethical-Ambition.jpg" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1094" src="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2015/04/Ethical-Ambition-104x150.jpg" alt="Ethical Ambition" width="104" height="150" /></a>e a life of passion, to have the courage to take risks for what we believe in, to rely on our loved ones and out faith for support during hard times, and to have the humility to know when our best intentions go awry&#8221; (front cover).</p>


		<p>The &#8220;eve of departure&#8221; for the 2015 Global Perspectives Program is rapidly approaching.  And as I contemplate another departure, I&#8217;m struck by the fact that this is the 10th year of the program.   For me, each year brings a similar level of excitement and wonder about the journey we will take individually and collectively.  Every cohort is different although each cohort believes they are the &#8220;best&#8221;.   Better or best are not words I use to describe the various cohorts for each cohort is unique and brings their perspectives to the journey.  Our individual goals and objectives vary; our interactions evolve, a sense of community builds and the experience lasts much longer than our time abroad.  Each trip is terrific producing fond memories and friendships that last a life-time.  To date, more than 120 VT graduate students participated in the GPP program &#8211; future professoriate: <a href="http://graduateschool.vt.edu/GPP">global perspectives program.</a>  And I have appreciated all of the experiences over the years.</p>
<p>So on the eve of my departure this year, I reflect on the 10 years of the program.   I looked back on two previous blogs about departures for <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2012/05/14/on-the-eve-of-departure/">GPP 2012</a> and for<a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/?s=eve+of+departure"> GPP&#8217;13</a>.   In both of these blogs, a theme emerges about observation and reflection.  I quote:  &#8220;As a part of the experience, I ask the Virginia Tech participants to keep journals and to write about their observations and personal reflections.  As I challenge myself daily, I encourage the GPPers to see new things and to see things in new ways (e.g., the <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2012/05/14/on-the-eve-of-departure/">doors and windows</a>) and to see the <a title="Seeing the unobvious: Fed Ex and other visuals" href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2012/10/24/seeing-the-unobvious-fed-ex-and-other-visuals/">unobvious</a>.&#8221;  When we meet at &#8220;Hotel St. Josef in Zurich, Switzerland at 3pm (1500) on Sunday May 24, 2015&#8221; I will once again talk about looking at the windows and doors, markets and stores, streets and sidewalks, and more.  And I will encourage us to look for the unobvious and see things through a different cultural lens.</p>
<p>The eve of departure always tends to coincide with VT Commencement Ceremonies.  This seems fitting inasmuch as <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2014/05/21/commencement-a-beginning-not-an-ending/">commencement is also a beginning</a> &#8211; a beginning of new journey.  GPP&#8217;15 is a beginning, a new journey and one that we anticipate.</p>
<p>The fourteen plus Michael and me will travel different routes to Zurich, spend the next 12 days together and on June 4th we begin our return and re-entry.  Please read follow the <a href="http://blogs.lt.vt.edu/pfpswitzerland/">GPP Switzerland blog</a>, read about the <a href="http://blogs.lt.vt.edu/pfpswitzerland/2015-gpp-cohort/">VT participants</a> and UniBasel group along the way, and follow up on social media (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/GlobalPerspectivesProgramVirginiaTech">Facebook</a>, twitter @gppvt or @kpdepauw, and more).  Please check out #gppswiss15.</p>

		<div>A significant portion of the 2015 Global Perspectives Program has come to a close and yet the impact has not been fully realized.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Departing the Villa Maderni in Riva San Vitale Switzerland, the Virginia Tech participants head home and await the arrival of the University of Basel participants to Blacksburg and the culminating event at the Swiss Embassy in Washington DC.  And of course, we look forward to these next events and further establishing connections with those who have become colleagues.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>We exit individually to re-enter our professional and personal lives but we will always be a part of this group &#8211; GPP2015.  During the days of GPP15, information was gathered and analyzed.  Facts learned and recorded.  Photos taken and posted.  Tweets sent and blogs shared.  Friendships formed. Future collaborations and collegial relationships considered.  As academics and future faculty, we value these and appreciate the opportunity to do so.</div>
<div></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>The Future Professoriate: Global Perspectives Program is much more than the professional experiences and knowledge gained.  It is also about intrapersonal and interpersonal growth, introspection and reflection.  As I reflected on the experiences in the last ten years and especially this year, I kept thinking about vulnerability and the GPP moments that we experienced during the time we spent together.   Not only does the program challenge us to learn to live with strangers, get out of our comfort zones, to face our biases and privilege openly and honesty and to deal with conflict and tensions but also provides a &#8220;safe&#8221; space in which these can occur.  I observed this year that the &#8220;safe&#8221; space often evolved into a &#8220;brave&#8221; space which was safe and allowed for ideas, beliefs and hypotheses to be explored, critiqued and more fully developed. From those moments of vulnerability I could see the exploration and emergence of an authentic self.  Inasmuch as authenticity is a valued characteristic of an effective and engaging faculty member, I&#8217;m pleased that the GPP experience can create a space for learning more about oneself and allowing oneself to be open to change.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


		<p>My morning walk between the Villa Moderni and my apartment revealed the morning rituals of a small town in Ticino region of Switzerland &#8211; Riva San Vitale.  Although it is likely that these customs and morning activities are common in other towns I could feel the essence of this town awakening to a new day.  The street cleaner using straw brooms to clear the small trash from the day before.  The postal worker delivering the mail and newspapers to the homes along the alley.  Greetings offered to everyone who passed by including me, a familiar stranger in this town.  The butcher receiving the meat delivery and other cold goods.  The bread and cheese already delivered to be consumed with morning coffee.  Stores and restaurants opening. The rain has stopped and the fog is lifting to what will be another &#8220;beautiful day in paradise.&#8221;</p>
<p>The day of departure for GPP15 has come and gone and in fact, we&#8217;re close to the end of this phase of the global perspectives program.  Over the past 10+ days, we have experienced the awakening of new days, not just with the rituals of the morning but also of new revelations, insights and questions to explore.  Each day we have learned some things new (and anew), passionately discussed issues and examined our own biases and perspectives.  We have continuously reflected on that has been shared with us through our visits to the universities. We have, I hope, learned to see things differently and understand through a different lens.</p>
<p>Today the UniBasel participants arrive in Ticino and the GPP15 experience will expand.  A rich discussion of &#8220;global higher education: accountability and relevance&#8221; is expected along with lively more social conversation in the garden.  And then onto the Swiss Embassy in Washington DC.</p>
<p>The GPP15 experience began some days ago and it will continue.  GPP provides not only a challenge but also opportunities to effect change in global higher education.  Please join me in finding ways to continue the journey.</p>
<p>I will miss the morning walks to the Villa.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


		<p>Virginia Tech has developed an initiative called <a href="http://www.inclusive.vt.edu" target="_blank">InclusiveVT</a> which now serves an umbrella for inclusion and diversity efforts.  VT President Timothy Sands has publicly stated that inclusion is the goal and with inclusion will come diversity.  For more information, see the <a href="http://www.inclusive.vt.edu">InclusiveVT </a>website and <a href="http://blogs.lt.vt.edu/diversity/" target="_blank">blog</a>.</p>
<p>Most of us would say that we understand and would be able to define inclusion. And we would commonly define inclusion as the &#8220;action of including or being included within a group or structure&#8221;.  Although accurate, inclusion is and has to be more.</p>
<p>From my perspective, inclusion thus is not simply about including individuals of diverse backgrounds into existing groups or structures (society).  It has to be about changing the culture of the group or structure (institution) as well so that individuals could be and are included.   Without such change, individuals might be &#8220;present&#8221; in the structure but might and often do feel excluded.  With cultural change, the modified structure would then be more inclusive and less representative of the status quo. Institutions of higher education have been very slow to change but they must.  To do less is to fall short of the transformational change toward inclusivity needed in higher education.</p>

Since then, many books have been written, articles published, and conferences held.  In the early 21st century, two prominent federal funding agencies (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/additional_resources/interdisciplinary_research/">NSF</a>, NIH) would articulate the importance of interdisciplinary research (and graduate education) through the <a href="http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11153/facilitating-interdisciplinary-research">publication </a>of <em>Facilitating Interdisciplinary Research</em> (2004, National Academies Press) and <em>NIH</em> <em><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1289386/">Roadmap</a> Interdisciplinary Research initiatives</em> (2005, National Institutes of Health).</p>
<p>With increased attention about interdisciplinary research including the notion of &#8220;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp/grand-challenges">grand challenges</a>&#8220;, the development and implementation of interdisciplinary programs followed.  Leading the discussions at the graduate level was the Council of Graduate Schools (CGS) that offered sessions during its annual meetings and summer workshops.  Having been a participant in these conversations, the focus was primarily on content knowledge and research methodologies cutting across disciplines and the development of graduate degree programs.  Examples of good practices exist (e.g.,<a href="http://www.gradschool.psu.edu/prospective-students/interdisciplinary-graduate-training/"> Penn State</a>, <a href="http://ucdavis.edu/research/interdisciplinary.html">University of California-Davis</a>, <a href="http://www.graduate.ucf.edu/InterdisciplinaryPrograms/">University of Central Florida</a>, <a href="https://www.grad.umn.edu/projects-priorities/interdisciplinaryinitiatives">University of Minnesota</a>, <a href="http://www.grad.washington.edu/students/interdisciplinary/">University of Washington</a>, <a href="http://interdisciplinary.graduateschool.vt.edu/home">Virginia Tech</a>).  At Virginia Tech, we have also established a <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/vtige/">blog site</a> as a means of sharing research across interdisciplinary degree programs as well.  And all the while, very little discussion has occurred around interdisciplinary thinking and its relationship to graduate education until CGS President Suzanne Ortega invited Vice Provost Frances Leslie (UC Irvine) and me to facilitate such a discussion.  A great discussion occurred; the results of which will be shared in a different forum.  What follows here are my reflections and musings about interdisciplinary thinking in preparation for and after that session.</p>
<p>I have previously blogged about <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2012/03/28/interdisciplinary-thinking-pi-and-adaptive-innovators/">interdisciplinary thinking</a> and <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2014/10/27/i-t-and-pi-as-metaphors-for-graduate-education/">different metaphors</a> for graduate education.  I proposed the symbol of &#8220;<a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2014/10/27/i-t-and-pi-as-metaphors-for-graduate-education/">pi</a>&#8221; as metaphor for interdisciplinary (transdisciplinary as well) <a href="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2012/03/images.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="65" data-permalink="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2012/03/28/interdisciplinary-thinking-pi-and-adaptive-innovators/images/" data-orig-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2012/03/images.jpg" data-orig-size="225,225" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="images" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2012/03/images.jpg" data-large-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2012/03/images.jpg" class="alignleft  wp-image-65" src="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2012/03/images-150x150.jpg" alt="images" width="36" height="36" srcset="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2012/03/images-150x150.jpg 150w , https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2012/03/images.jpg 225w " sizes="(max-width: 36px) 100vw, 36px" /></a>and preparing graduate students to become adaptive innovators.  My musings about interdisciplinary thinking continue and have been informed by Simeon Dreyfuss article entitled <a href="http://www.oakland.edu/upload/docs/AIS/Issues%20in%20Interdisciplinary%20Studies/2011%20Volume%2029/05_Vol_29_pp_67_83_Something_Essential_About_Interdisciplinary_Thinking_(Simeon_Dreyfuss).pdf">&#8220;Something essential about interdisciplinary thinking</a>&#8221; published in 2011 in <span style="text-decoration: underline">Issues in Integrative Studies</span> (29, 67-83)</p>
<p>So how do I understand interdisciplinary thinking?  Interdisciplinary thinking (I-thinking) must extend beyond the sharing of content and methodology from different disciplinary perspectives.  I-thinking must reach beyond common courses, shared research projects, case studies and joint publications. I-thinking most likely involves team science especially collaboration and clear, direct communication.</p>
<p>I-thinking should involve problem solving as well as problem defining and problem posing.  Yes, it involves what is known as critical thinking skills however these are defined. It is about asking questions and &#8220;sitting with&#8221; the question before jumping to solutions or answers quickly.  I-thinking takes time and requires perseverance.</p>
<p>Interdisciplinary thinking is about different ways of knowing and knowing differently and knowing in relationship to other even dissimilar views. It is about differing modalities of thinking and learning which requires acceptance of and tolerance for ambiguity and dissonance and perhaps confusion at times.  Creativity and innovation are key components and outcomes of interdisciplinary thinking.</p>
<p>Interdisciplinary thinking is a non-linear process and doesn&#8217;t embrace dualities but seeks intersections and connections.  I-thinking is about acknowledging the notion of a &#8220;baggy idea of truth, understanding the multiplicity of truth and the ongoing search for evolving truth.  It involves looking for and seeing the &#8220;<a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2012/10/24/seeing-the-unobvious-fed-ex-and-other-visuals/">unobvious</a>&#8221; &#8211; to see things in ways which might not be obvious.</p>
<p>Interdisciplinary thinking is not only integrative but much more.  Beyond analysis and synthesis across disciplines, interdisciplinary thinking must be iterative and emergent.</p>
<p>Dreyfuss (2011) wrote that the difference between disciplinary and interdisciplinary thinking is &#8220;a manifestation of how deeply one is wed to particular historical institutionalizations of knowledge&#8221; (p. 80). In order to prepare the graduate students for the future, graduate deans must encourage programs and provide opportunities to push beyond the historical institutionalization of knowledge and disciplinary boundaries into interdisciplinary thinking.  The abilities and skills associated with interdisciplinary thinking will serve all graduate students well in discipline-based or interdisciplinary programs.</p>
<p>So, the question now is how.</p>


		<p>Academic bullying. In what ways does it manifest itself?  When does it occur? Why does it exist?  And most importantly, how can bullying be eliminated and an affirming environment for graduate education be enhanced?  The questions are many, the answers actually complex.</p>
<p>Academic bullying has become increasingly more visible in the past few years and might even to a<img data-attachment-id="1211" data-permalink="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2015/10/18/academic-bullying/professors-behaving-badly/" data-orig-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2015/10/Professors-behaving-badly.jpg" data-orig-size="106,160" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Professors behaving badly" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2015/10/Professors-behaving-badly.jpg" data-large-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2015/10/Professors-behaving-badly.jpg" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1211" src="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2015/10/Professors-behaving-badly-106x150.jpg" alt="Professors behaving badly" width="106" height="150" />ppear as being more tolerated in higher education today.  One comprehensive study was conducted and the results published in 2011 by John M. Braxton, Eve Proper, and Alan E. Bayer entitled <em><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=XoL_D5xxmJoC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s">Professors Behaving Badly: Faculty Misconduct in Graduate Education</a>.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several other books on bullying have been written in the last few years. Articles, reports and coverage within the higher education media (see articles in <a href="http://chronicle.com/">Chronicle of Higher Education</a>, <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/">InsideHigherEd</a>) occur with some frequency.<img data-attachment-id="1209" data-permalink="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2015/10/18/academic-bullying/faculty-incivility/" data-orig-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2015/10/faculty-incivility.jpg" data-orig-size="214,320" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="faculty incivility" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2015/10/faculty-incivility-201x300.jpg" data-large-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2015/10/faculty-incivility.jpg" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1209" src="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2015/10/faculty-incivility-150x150.jpg" alt="faculty incivility" width="150" height="150" /> <img data-attachment-id="1213" data-permalink="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2015/10/18/academic-bullying/workplace-bullying-in-he/" data-orig-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2015/10/workplace-bullying-in-HE.jpg" data-orig-size="214,320" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="workplace bullying in HE" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2015/10/workplace-bullying-in-HE-201x300.jpg" data-large-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2015/10/workplace-bullying-in-HE.jpg" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1213" src="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2015/10/workplace-bullying-in-HE-150x150.jpg" alt="workplace bullying in HE" width="150" height="150" /> <img data-attachment-id="1212" data-permalink="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2015/10/18/academic-bullying/bullying-in-ivory-tower/" data-orig-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2015/10/Bullying-in-Ivory-tower.jpg" data-orig-size="331,500" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Bullying in Ivory tower" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2015/10/Bullying-in-Ivory-tower-199x300.jpg" data-large-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2015/10/Bullying-in-Ivory-tower.jpg" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1212" src="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2015/10/Bullying-in-Ivory-tower-150x150.jpg" alt="Bullying in Ivory tower" width="150" height="150" /> Bullying exists in higher education and Graduate Schools must assume a leadership role in addressing the concerns for graduate education and graduate students.</p>
<p>Although the terminology of &#8216;academic bullying&#8217; is recent, the emphasis upon quality of and for graduate education extends back to at least the 1990s including prominent examples from AAU and the AAUP.  The Association of American Universities (AAU) established the <a href="https://www.aau.edu/policy/graded_background.aspx?id=6878">Committee on Graduate Education</a> and issued its report calling on universities to examine graduate education programs (<a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/files/2015/10/AAU-GradEd-report.pdf">AAU GradEd report).</a>  Shortly thereafter in 1999, the AAUP established policy about graduate education and <a href="http://www.aaup.org/issues/graduate-students/resources-graduate-students">resources </a>for graduate students.  Mentoring, collegial relationships and affirming education + equitable employment conditions were important and remain so. Civility should be the expectation and bullying should not be tolerated.</p>
<p>Today, most if not all of the U.S. Graduate Schools now have statements and documents in which they articulate the established principles for graduate education frequently referred to as principles or guiding principles, codes, or expectations. Even though the terminology of &#8216;academic bullying&#8217; might not be specifically mentioned, the intent of these documents is to articulate the expectations for quality graduate education and an affirming climate for graduate students.  This is the approach taken by the Virginia Tech Graduate School.  We entitled our document Expectations for Graduate Study in which the expectations for graduate students, faculty, departments/programs and the Graduate School were articulated.  A <a href="http://graduateschool.vt.edu/node/6042">website </a>was created along with a summary of the expectations <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/files/2015/10/Expectation_Glance_2011.pdf">Expectation_Glance_2011</a>.</p>
<p>The VT Graduate School is committed to enhancing the graduate education experience and providing opportunities for graduate students to thrive.  We are changing the paradigm from survival, silence and acceptance of status quo to <a href="http://graduateschool.vt.edu/gs/tge">transforming graduate education</a>. The conversation about academic bullying will continue.  Watch for additional blog posts, information about models and promising practices, and ways to share concerns anonymously.</p>


		<p>The Virginia Tech Graduate School is committed to providing a &#8220;rich learning environment&#8221; for graduate students and a quality graduate education experience.  To do so requires clear communication about policy and procedures and especially the expectations for graduate study.  The VT Graduate School&#8217;s commitment is articulated in the &#8220;<a href="http://graduateschool.vt.edu/node/6042">Expectations for Graduate Education at Virginia Tech</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Originally created by graduate students and faculty in 2003, the expectations document was revised in 2011 and highlights the &#8220;vital elements of 21st-century graduate education, including ethics, civility, professional and academic development, teaching/learning, and inclusive community&#8221;.  The document describes the <a href="http://graduateschool.vt.edu/node/6051">graduate environment</a> promoted at VT and articulates expectations for <a href="http://graduateschool.vt.edu/node/6044">graduate students</a>, <a href="http://graduateschool.vt.edu/node/6045">faculty</a>, <a href="http://graduateschool.vt.edu/node/6046">departments</a> (programs, schools) and the <a href="http://graduateschool.vt.edu/node/6047">Graduate School</a>.  The document also includes a section on <a href="http://graduateschool.vt.edu/node/6059">mentoring</a> and a section on <a href="http://graduateschool.vt.edu/node/6060">complaints and the appeals process</a>.  A <a href="http://graduateschool.vt.edu/sites/default/files/u12/expectations/Expectation_Glance_2011.pdf">summary</a> of the expectations are shared in a printable format as well.</p>
<p>The expectations are discussed in relation to major components of graduate education: progress toward degree, research and ethics, teaching and training, professional development, assistantships and financial aid, and community.  Although written in 2011, the expectations still provide relevant guidelines for graduate education today. Examples include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear communication about departmental and Graduate School policy and procedures</li>
<li>Regular communication between faculty advisor and student</li>
<li>Understand and adhere to responsible conduct of research and scholarly endeavors</li>
<li>Discuss and agree upon requirements and expectation for authorship</li>
<li>Ensure that graduate programs conform to the highest academic standards and remain relevant through appropriate curriculum</li>
<li>Adherence to professional codes of conduct, student conduct and honor codes</li>
<li>Provide appropriate teacher training and professional development opportunities</li>
<li>Provide annual feedback to students and provide opportunity for students to correct academic deficiencies</li>
<li>Ensure fair and equitable treatment of students</li>
<li>Provide a safe and collegial work environment; respect work-life balance and working conditions</li>
<li>Provide pertinent resources and mentoring for degree completion</li>
</ul>
<div class="page" title="Page 1">While the information seems fairly straightforward and common sense, it is valuable to have the expectations clearly identified and shared with the graduate students and faculty in order to provide the foundation for a quality graduate education experience at the beginning of one&#8217;s graduate study and to remind faculty, departments and the Graduate School of our collective responsibility for quality graduate education. The goal of graduate education should be to provide the academic context(s) and mentoring that allows graduate students to demonstrate their ability to achieve, their desire to succeed and their commitment to future professional contributions.</div>
<div class="page" title="Page 1"></div>
<div class="page" title="Page 1">Unfortunately, academic bullying and questionable professional behavior are still prevalent in higher education.  And as I mentioned in the previous blog entitled <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2015/11/09/academic-bullying-and-graduate-education/">Academic Bullying and graduate education</a>, these must be eliminated from graduate education and replaced with a challenging yet affirming academic environment.</div>


		<p>A recent study by Gentry and Whitely (2014) entitled &#8220;Bullying in Graduate School: Its Nature and Effects&#8221; concluded that although graduate students did experience &#8216;aggressive and exclusionary&#8217; behaviors associated with traditional definition of bullying they tended to reject the use of &#8220;bullying&#8221; to describe their experiences. (see The Qualitative Report 2014 Volume 19, Article 71, 1-18 http://www.nova.edu/ssss/QR/QR19/gentry71.pdf).  The behaviors were experienced were as more &#8220;covert and indirect&#8221; rather than typical images of playground bullying.  These behaviors could also be described under the umbrella of micro aggressions, incivilities, and acts based upon unconscious bias.  To emphasize the importance of understanding these behaviors, how they manifest  themselves in graduate school, and the significant impact that they can have on graduate students, I have written about and will continue to use the terminology of &#8220;<a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2015/10/18/academic-bullying/">academic bullying</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>Academic bullying manifests itself in many different ways and can include intimidation, humiliation, belittlement, embarrassment and undermining one&#8217;s authority.  Academic bullying also includes behaviors or comments that indicate disregard of one&#8217;s concerns, ignoring contributions, minimize one&#8217;s efforts in the eyes of colleagues, and other means of exclusion or withholding information.  Expectations of unreasonable workload, limiting earned vacation and prohibiting graduate student&#8217;s own agency for professional choices and personal decision could also be inappropriate.  As is well known, comments or behaviors that are sexist, racist, homophobic, xenophobic and more are unacceptable and can fall under the umbrella of academic bullying and should not be tolerated.  Academic bullying occurs throughout the academic or professional space; in the classroom, in meetings, at conferences, in the laboratory setting, in face-to-face interactions, and of course through email and social media.</p>
<p>Essentially, the behaviors and actions described above would be considered unprofessional and could be considered as &#8220;misconduct&#8221;. In their book entitled <em>Professors Behaving Badly: Faculty Misconduct in Graduate Education</em>, the authors (Braxton, Proper &amp; Bayer, 2011) provide some more specific examples based upon their study including the following (more discussion in a later blog post):</p>
<p><a href="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2015/10/Professors-behaving-badly.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="1211" data-permalink="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2015/10/18/academic-bullying/professors-behaving-badly/" data-orig-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2015/10/Professors-behaving-badly.jpg" data-orig-size="106,160" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Professors behaving badly" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2015/10/Professors-behaving-badly.jpg" data-large-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2015/10/Professors-behaving-badly.jpg" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1211" src="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2015/10/Professors-behaving-badly-106x150.jpg" alt="Professors behaving badly" width="106" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>• Publishing an article without a graduate student among the authors who made significant contributions to the study.</p>
<p>• Prohibiting graduate students from expressions differing viewpoints.</p>
<p>• Requiring additional hours of work per week regularly beyond that of the assistantship and on nights, weekends and vacation times.</p>
<p>While it is important to understand what constitutes academic bullying, it is just as important to understand the context for graduate education and what would not be considered as academic bullying.  Graduate school should be challenging and is sometimes difficult and frustrating.  Graduate school should not be demoralizing although students might occasionally question their ability to perform.  Graduate students need to understand the conditions for graduate study set by the Graduate School and the department or faculty.  Obviously there are policies and procedures that need to be followed.  Academic freedom is valued and respected for graduate students and faculty.  Freedom of speech is a right but must be exercised in an atmosphere of respect for others. Disagreements are likely and emotions will be expressed but must be civil.  To read about the VT Graduate School&#8217;s description of the graduate environment, link <a href="http://graduateschool.vt.edu/node/6051">here</a>.</p>
<p>Communication and clarity are key to success in graduate school.  The next blog will focus on <a href="http://graduateschool.vt.edu/node/6042">expectations for graduate study</a> and ways in which we can move the conversation about graduate school from surviving to thriving.</p>


		<p>Thriving has not been the typical term used to describe the graduate education experience; rather &#8220;surviving&#8221; has been the term associated with earning a graduate degree. But now it is time to question this existing paradigm and move from surviving to thriving through the implementation of affirming, and yet still challenging, environments for advanced learning and research. High expectations and quality standards can be and should be maintained but the academic bullying (subtle or overt) and questionable professional behaviors must be eliminated.</p>
<p>Based upon their research of faculty conduct with graduate students, <a href="https://jhupbooks.press.jhu.edu/content/professors-behaving-badly">Braxton, Proper and Bayer (2011)</a> derived a &#8220;normative structure&#8221; that includes &#8220;inviolable norms&#8221; and &#8220;admonitory norms&#8221;. The inviolable norms included disrespect for student efforts, misappropriation of student work, harassment of students, whistle-blowing suppression, and directed research malfeasance. The admonitory norms were identified as neglectful teaching, inadequate advising/mentoring, degradation of faculty colleagues, negligent thesis/dissertation advising, insufficient course structure, pedagogical narrowness, student assignment misallocation, and disregard for program.  As a result of their work, we can better understand these broad categories of faculty behavior and can provide &#8220;guidelines of appropriate and inappropriate behaviors&#8221; for graduate education.</p>
<p>To address and counter these &#8220;norms&#8221; found in graduate education, we need a cultural shift and commitment of faculty and departments as well as the graduate school to encourage strategies that foster an affirming environment for graduate education.  Examples might include (but are not limited to):</p>

<li>Development of quality mentoring programs and recognition for faculty who engage in mentoring (e.g., outstanding mentor award, mentor of the month)</li>
<li>Professional development programs for faculty and graduate students (e.g., <a href="http://graduateschool.vt.edu/gs/tge">Transformative Graduate Education</a>) in the roles and responsibilities of a 21st century faculty member including teaching/learning, advising/mentoring, directing thesis/dissertation, lab management, and more.</li>
<li>Graduate teaching assistantship training programs (e.g., <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/jwrgrad/about-this-site/">GTA workshop</a>, <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/jwrgrad/academy-for-advanced-teaching-and-transforming-learning-aattl/">Academy for GTA Excellence</a>) and recognition for graduate teaching excellence (e.g., GTA awards)</li>
<li>Emphasis upon inclusion and diversity especially inclusive pedagogy and affirming diverse environments. Workshops and education to understand unconscious biases and eliminating micro-aggressions (see <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/files/2015/11/Tool_Recognizing_Microaggressions1.pdf">Tool_Recognizing_Microaggressions)</a></li>
<li>Building graduate community within and beyond departmental/college boundaries; Graduate Schools can play a significant role and assume <a href="http://www.graduatelifecenter.vt.edu/">responsibility </a>here as well.</li>
<li>Utilization of holistic admissions process and ongoing inclusive retention strategies</li>
<li>Annual progress review with honest constructive feedback; equitable appeal process</li>
<li>Establishment of an Office of the Graduate Student <a href="http://www.graduate.ombudsman.vt.edu/">Ombudsperson</a></li>
<li>Establishment of an honor code, ethics requirement, graduate student handbooks and <a href="http://graduateschool.vt.edu/node/6042">expectations</a> for graduate study</li>
<li>Engage and work closely with graduate students in creating positive learning environments</li>
<li>Communicate directly and work closely with faculty to create academic environments in which graduate students can thrive</li>
<li>Celebrate achievements and graduate student success</li>
</ol>
<p>Thriving not surviving.  Please join me in the conversation.</p>


		<p>InclusiveVT was developed in July 2014 as a framework for Virginia Tech to become a more inclusive and diverse university.  An overview of the effort, recent report and events can be found on the <a href="http://www.inclusive.vt.edu">website</a>, the <a href="http://blogs.lt.vt.edu/diversity/inclusivevt-initiative/">inclusion and diversity blog</a> and through social media (twitter, Facebook, Instagram and more).</p>
<p>As part of the effort, senior leadership was asked to develop three initiatives for implementation starting during the 2014-2015 academic year. As one of those administrative units, the Graduate School had previously developed many programs and opportunities focused on <a href="http://graduateschool.vt.edu/diversity">diversity and inclusion</a> including an office of Recruitment and Diversity Initiatives (ORDI) and wanted to develop initiatives that would promote pervasive change and actively engage constituency groups across the university in transformative change.</p>
<p>In this post, I will report specifically on the progress made on the Graduate School’s three InclusiveVT initiatives:  holistic admissions, inclusive Graduate Life Center (GLC) and affirming environment for graduate education.</p>
<p>Holistic admissions in graduate education</p>
<p>In preparation for action, Graduate School staff investigated the use of holistic admissions at selected universities in the U.S. to identify promising practices. The next step was to survey departments and programs to determine the admission practices already in use at VT.  After reviewing the results of the surveys and wanting to identify admission criteria beyond the typical GPA, GRE scores (or other standardized test scores) and reputation of the university, we decided to make changes to the Graduate School application and the letters of recommendation process. Based specifically on information provided by our departments and programs we modified the application so that applicants could provide additional educational experience for consideration in admissions: community involvement and/or service; leadership; overcoming social, economic and/or physical barriers; personal and/or professional ethics; recognition of achievements over time; and research and scholarship.</p>
<p>In alignment with the personal attributes critical to academic success studied intensively by Educational Testing Services in its development of the Personal Potential Index (PPI), we modified the letter of recommendation form to include specific questions about the following: communication skills, ethics and integrity, initiative, innovation and creativity, planning and organization, and teamwork. Letter writers are asked to evaluate the applicant on these attributes and then provide a brief statement about the most compelling reason to admit the candidate. Full letters of recommendation are still to be submitted.</p>
<p>The changes in the application and the letter of recommendation form were designed and built in such a fashion that departments/programs can “sort” by the additional educational experiences and personal attributes as well as GPA and other measures departments wish.  Admissions committee are encouraged to use these experiences and attributes systematically in determining qualified candidates and not just &#8220;sort&#8221; by high GPA and high GREs. Specifically, department are asked to &#8220;sort&#8221; initially and then revisit the applicant pool to “sort” at least two more times to expand the pool by the addition of those who were rated high on the pertinent additional educational experiences and personal attributes of value for academic success. We have collected data on the demographics of the pool of qualified applicants (admissible or admitted) in the last three years and will compare these with the data to be collected starting for Fall ’16. It is anticipated that these changes will allows for an increase in the size and diversity of the pool of qualified applicants. Beginning in mid Fall’15, we have conducted workshops and information sessions about holistic admissions and I am personally holding college-level meetings to discuss holistic admissions and affirming environment for graduate education.</p>
<p>Inclusive GLC and Affirming Environment for graduate education</p>
<p>These two initiatives are both focused on creating an affirming and welcoming &#8220;space and place&#8221; for graduate education; the first initiative is focused on the Graduate Life Center (including the Graduate School) and its people, program, place, policies and more and the second is focused more broadly on the broader university departments and programs. Specific activities have included the establishment of a GLC advisory committee to define inclusivity in terms of the physical space, attributes and policies of the Graduate Life Center. Also in the mix is an examination of the GLC promotional materials, evaluation mechanisms, and future programs. Educational programs and workshops have been initiated for GLC and Graduate School employees for understanding unconscious bias and micro-aggressions along with a commitment to the Principles of Community and inclusivity in hiring of new employees and in the annual review process of current employees.</p>
<p>Many efforts are directed toward creating more affirming and welcoming environments for graduate education. Among these are an revised entry survey and an exit survey developed to understand why individuals chose to enroll (or not) at Virginia Tech and to gather information about their experiences at VT upon completion of their degree. These have been helpful in enhancing the graduate experience at VT. We have also conducted “mid” surveys and more recently “climate surveys” to evaluate the climate for graduate education and wherever possible to determine why individuals chose to leave VT. With the goal of retention and provision of pertinent services and programs for our students it is important to understand more about their characteristics, varying attributes and multiple identities. Thus, we developed a post-admissions, pre-enrollment survey so that they can provide additional information about their needs and desires so that we can provide meaningful support services and programs.</p>
<p>Throughout this year and beyond, we will be conducting workshops and information sessions and gathering data about affirming practices and information about the graduate students’ experiences.   We are working with departments/programs to assist faculty and graduate students in dialogue about understanding privilege, unconscious bias and micro-aggressions. In support of these efforts, I have authored a series of blogs on <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2015/11/09/academic-bullying-and-graduate-education/">academic bullying</a>, <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2015/11/15/expectations-for-graduate-education-virginia-tech-graduate-school/">expectations for graduate education</a>, understanding <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2016/01/11/understanding-stress-in-context-to-thrive-in-graduate-school/">stress</a> and more to share my reflections and offer resources for others to create or enhance affirming environment for graduate education.</p>
<p>The most recent endeavor is to change the rhetoric and reality of graduate school from surviving to <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2015/12/01/thriving-in-graduate-school/">thriving</a>. Stay tuned &#8211; more to come on <em>Thriving in Graduate School</em>. Your thoughts and comments are welcomed.</p>


		<p>Graduate school should be challenging but doesn&#8217;t need to be overly stressful. Stress can come in many forms. Many graduate students will likely say that they experience stress in graduate school and that&#8217;s just part of being a graduate student.  As a graduate dean, I hear this frequently and understand but it is time to change the paradigm from surviving to <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2015/12/01/thriving-in-graduate-school/">thriving</a>.</p>
<p>A quick &#8220;google&#8221; search easily reveals a number of blogs, books and articles on tips for surviving even thriving in graduate school.  One example is the blog entitled <a href="http://thegradstudentway.com/blog/">Graduate Student Way</a> and a recent <a href="http://thegradstudentway.com/blog/?p=1727">post </a>with advice from three PhD students.  It is worth a quick read to understand that one is not alone and the feelings are common among graduate students.  It also points out that<a href="http://jameshaytonphd.com/phd-stress-dont-ignore-the-warning-signs/"> warning signs of stress</a> should not be ignored but understood and addressed.</p>
<p>Other examples include an article on <a href="http://psychcentral.com/lib/12-tips-for-surviving-and-thriving-in-grad-school/?all=1">12 tips for surviving and surviving in grad school,</a> a self-published <a href="http://www.d-hh-nguyen.com/#!surviving-graduate-school/c1bum">book </a>by David Nguyen which offers some basic tips for surviving graduate school and an archived site from University of Oregon called <a href="http://blogs.uoregon.edu/survivegradschool/">Survive Grad School</a> that contains some valuable information.  Many Graduate Schools today offer resources and guidance for graduate student success on their websites, at orientations and workshops and through social media (e.g., <a href="http://www.unl.edu/gradstudies/current/news/thriving-graduate-school">UNL</a>, <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/kbrimac/thriving-in-grad-school-gps-presentation-aug-2013150ppi">UBC</a>, <a href="http://gradlife.gmu.edu/thriving/">GMU</a>).</p>
<p>Lots of good advice and tips are available but I wish to encourage actions of a more personal nature that are often de-emphasized during graduate education. Here, I pull from the advice offered by University of California at Berkeley (UCB) regarding <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:qiUVoKXszV0J:www.uhs.berkeley.edu/bewell/grad%2520student%2520stress.pdf+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us">stress </a>and graduate school.  Please read and consider the four primary points that are encouraged: make yourself a priority, take control of your life, avoid procrastination through time management, and look for social support.  These tend to go counter to the perceived &#8220;survival&#8221; nature required for graduate school and the toughness and persistence at all costs needed for success. Rather, I would argue that taking time for oneself is critical.  Although a graduate student can sometimes feel as if one doesn&#8217;t have control, it is important to exercise one&#8217;s agency and control over one&#8217;s life.  Further it is important to learn to say &#8220;no&#8221; and to establish some balance between graduate study and personal life. Of course, time management is crucial to academic progress and when there&#8217;s lots of work to do and deadlines, managing one&#8217;s time becomes even more important. As is a key component of the VT Graduate School&#8217;s experience, establishing a community (communities) and social networks for support are critical.  These are essential within the academic setting as well as beyond the university setting.</p>
<p>In my welcome remarks to incoming graduate students, I share<a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2014/02/02/doodles-and-other-musings-of-the-mind/"> four conditions for graduate study</a>: academic quality, time to fiddle, a baggy idea of truth, and a sense of community.  I encourage the graduate students to reflect upon these throughout their graduate study and to realize that failure is a part of the learning process.  I also encourage them to work hard and to play as well.  To thrive in graduate school is to enjoy the challenge and to pursue opportunities as they present themselves.</p>
<p>One additional thought.  Keep a sense of humor because it helps to keep one grounded and attentive to the richness of the graduate experience.  Visit <a href="http://phdcomics.com/comics.php">PhD comics</a>.</p>


		<p>Institutions of higher education (IHEs) have often been viewed as slow to change and to prefer, and even perpetuate, the status quo or the &#8220;way we have always done it&#8221;.   Thus, IHEs often appear to be (or are) risk-averse and reluctant to change.  But change is clearly needed amidst the many challenges facing higher education today.  In addition to the challenges, there are many and varied opportunities and possibilities.</p>
<p>In thinking about the future for higher education and working toward transformative change (evolution and especially revolution), the challenges tend to visible immediately and the associated risks often become the reasons that we question if we can or if we should move forward. Even though progress is always possible, change is often limited by the risks or the perception of risk and possible failure. Some academic leaders are risk-averse or take actions that appear to be risk-averse, but I would argue that risk must be acknowledged and welcomed as a part of our growth individually and professionally and institutional change.</p>
<p>To effect change we must adapt our thinking to be futuristic and simultaneously embrace risk as a critical element for significant progress to be made; that is futurisktic.  Futurisktic thinking can also be seen as a way of thinking not just about the future but as a mindset for engaging with today&#8217;s challenges and associated risks in pursuing the opportunities that emerge.</p>
<p>A few thoughts about being futurisktic relative to graduate education. Graduate deans and graduate schools can be agents for change by taking the risk and leading the way in challenging the status quo.  For graduate education, the status quo has played out in many ways but only two are mentioned here: assumption that &#8216;surviving graduate school&#8217; is the norm and the way to evaluate performance is primarily through known markers of success while ignoring or dismissing failure.</p>
<p>Obviously we should strive for success but still note that much can be learned from failures. For graduate education, academic leaders should accept the responsibility to create the space for encouraging graduate students to take risks in pursuit of greater understanding knowing full well that failure is possible. As we know well, failure is a critical component of learning and research.</p>
<p>Surviving graduate school has been the recent rhetoric about the graduate student experience and I advocate to change the rhetoric and reality from surviving to <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2015/12/01/thriving-in-graduate-school/"><strong>thriving</strong></a>. Thriving provides an alternative metaphor for the experience and should guide us toward to the future. Thriving doesn&#8217;t mean lowering of quality or expectations. It is about empowering graduate students and providing the space to seek opportunities and take risks. Thriving allows for more creativity and innovation within the graduate education experience.  As a Graduate Dean, I encourage us to think differently about graduate education for the future (that&#8217;s a topic of a future blog), take some risks and encourage being futurisktic.</p>
<p>Futurisktic: of the future that includes risk (that&#8217;s okay) and taking risks (that&#8217;s good)</p>


		<p>What defines a 21st century university?  How do we envision a vibrant university for (of) the 21st century?  How can we transform traditional universities?</p>
<p>Although these discussions began in the 1990s, focused attention on change for today&#8217;s universities is happening now as institutions of higher education find themselves at a metaphorical &#8220;fork in the road&#8217;. Change has happened in higher education throughout time but the pace of change in society today is far greater than it has ever been &#8211; so rapid that it is indeed difficult for universities to keep up let alone anticipate change.</p>
<p>Through my lens as an academic administrator and professor, the university of the 21st century must be adaptive, innovative and agile. As technology continues to evolve and the complexity of societal problems increase, the nature of work (and life) changes and jobs are changing more rapidly than degrees. There seems to be a growing gap between the university curriculum and the knowledge and skills needed for the 21st century employment. Thus, one example of significant challenges for the university is to prepare graduates for jobs (work) that don&#8217;t yet exist. To meet this challenge, the traditional university curriculum approach must become more inclusive, adaptive and individualized with emphasis upon interdisciplinary and integrative thinking as well as experiential learning with real-world projects.</p>
<p>Currently, Virginia Tech President Timothy Sands has issued a <a href="http://www.beyondboundaries.vt.edu/challenge.html">challenge </a>and engaged the university community in a conversation about transformation and changes facing the university entitled <a href="http://www.beyondboundaries.vt.edu/index.php">&#8220;Beyond Boundaries</a>&#8220;.  Beyond Boundaries is a &#8220;visioning process to support two interrelated goals: advancing Virginia Tech as a global land-grant institution, and strategically addressing the challenges and opportunities presented by the changing landscape of higher education&#8221;.  Four thematic<a href="http://www.beyondboundaries.vt.edu/about.html"> areas of inquiry</a> provide the context for change: advancing a global land grant, preparing students for the future world,discovering new funding models, and envisioning the campus of the future. The initiative has been in part framed around the anticipation that &#8220;a generation from now:</p>
<ul>
<li>life and work will be more global, mobile, technology mediated, interconnected and less steady/stable</li>
<li>students will seek knowledge, expertise, opportunity, flexibility</li>
<li>campus will comprise heterogeneous networks and innovation hubs facilitated by technology&#8221;  (from Beyond Boundaries presentation March 31, 2016)</li>
</ul>
<p>In conjunction with this initiative and as other institutions of higher education engage with transformation and envisioning a 21st century university, it will be important to examine existing structures and functions of our universities today.  As described in &#8220;An Avalanche in Coming&#8221; (2013), some university traditions and practices might need to be &#8220;unbundled&#8221;.  Examples include how outputs are measured (e.g., research, degrees, learning), how the people (e.g., faculty, staff, students) will be connected to the university (e.g., locations, networks), how curriculum is developed and how teaching/learning is delivered/received. Specifically, it will be important to contemplate questions such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>What if we rethink knowledge acquisition without or beyond degrees?</li>
<li>What if we rethink access in terms of access to skills not just the university?</li>
<li>What if  we rethink the education of students for the ability and skills to undertake projects rather than for specific jobs?</li>
<li>How do we evaluate interdisciplinary and integrative learning?</li>
<li>How do we implement a funding model that decreases costs and student debt?</li>
<li>How do we envision partnerships to prepare the future generations for the workforce?</li>
<li>How do we achieve authentic globalization and adopt a global perspective?</li>
</ol>
<p>These are just some of the questions to be asked and topics to be explored.  They are likely to be viewed as somewhat controversial or with skepticism but they will foster lively and informative dialogue about transformation of institutions of higher education (IHEs) into 21st C universities.  The challenges are real and so are the opportunities that follow when IHEs are willing to take some <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2015/04/09/risk-taking-and-higher-education-not-an-oxymoron/">risks</a>.</p>
<p>Continuing this line of thinking more related to my role in graduate education &#8211; what will graduate education look like in the future? How can we transform graduate education so that graduate students develop the intellectual and professional skills meaningful for complex problem solving needed for the 21st century workforce?  What is the future of the dissertation?  More on these in an upcoming blog.</p>

		<p>Once again, I find myself on the &#8220;eve of departure&#8221; for the Preparing the Future Professoriate: Switzerland program also known as Global Perspectives Program (GPP).   This year marks the 11th trip to Switzerland with brief side trips to Italy and France or Germany in some of the years. In addition, there have been &#8216;eves of departure&#8217; to Latin America; once to Chile and several now to Ecuador.  These represent some of the efforts of the VT Graduate School to encourage graduate students to embrace a global perspective and become global citizens.  Personally and professionally, I value a global perspective and want the same for VT graduate students.</p>
<p>On this &#8216;eve&#8217;, I think about the graduate students (15) who will participate this year and the colleges and universities (8), the countries (3), the UNESCO cultural heritage sites (2) and the Embassies (U.S., Swiss) we will visit.  We will meet and interact with professors, students and administrators.  Together with UniBasel and University Zürich (UZh) participants, we will explore aspects of the theme this year focused around the &#8220;EU&#8217;s Modernisation Agenda&#8221; during the GPP Seminar at the Steger Center in Riva San Vitale.  Our work in Riva San Vitale will be in preparation for the discussion at the Global Summit at the Swiss Embassy in Washington DC in June.</p>
<p>Our days will be full (and long) and rich with knowledge and greater understandings. The graduate students will pursue their individual topics to share their findings at our final seminar and in the digital GPP manual.  We will be briefed about the universities we visit as well as the cultural experiences.  We will debrief about our visits and experiences.  We will travel by airplane, trains, bus, and trams at least.  We will walk miles (kms) every day.</p>
<p>We will observe. We will listen. We will ask questions.  And throughout, we will reflect.  Reflection is an important component of the GPP experience. Participants are asked to keep a journal of their reflections including questions that I pose before departure and during our trip.  Journal prompts include entries about expectations and anticipations, what is a global university, surprises and reflections about Switzerland, learning outcomes, observations, and more.</p>
<p>There will be photos, videos and more photos. Group photos. Selfies. Photos of universities. Photos of food. Photos of castles. Photos of the Alps, windows and doors and more.</p>
<p>We will use social media: Twitter, FaceBook, Blogs, Snapchat, and more.  (I expect that I will learn to use other platforms this trip).  Our hashtag is #gppswiss16. And our trip will be captured in route through <a href="http://tripvis.org">http://tripvis.org</a> and via Storify upon our return.  So follow us as we share our individual and collective journeys.</p>
<p>The time will pass quickly and already has.  Our journey started in January five months ago and now it is time to &#8220;meet me at 15:00 (3pm) in Hotel St. Josef in Zürich on Sunday May 22nd&#8221;.</p>


		<p>The Global Perspectives Program is an intellectually stimulated and academic enriching experience.  GPP is about growth, both personal and professional.  It is a social and community or relationship building experience including elements of sharing space, finding place, and communicating.  GPP is a collective and individual journey that can be enjoyed through our multiple senses.</p>
<p>The GPP&#8217;16 experience has been documented through multiple venues and media.  The many visuals (e.g., tweets &#8211; #<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/gppswiss16">gppswiss16</a> and @<a href="https://twitter.com/gppvt">gppvt</a>, instagram, Facebook) and narratives (e.g., <a href="http://compthink.cs.vt.edu:3010/#/home/locations">tripvis</a>, tweets, <a href="http://blogs.lt.vt.edu/pfpswitzerland/">blogs</a>, posts) will capture the essence of GPP&#8217;16.  The GPP experience also includes a variety of tastes (e.g., coffee, food, wine) and smells (e.g., chocolate, bread, cheeses, flowers).  The kinesthetic sense was definitely experienced by walking 5-10 miles/day, often achieving more than 15,000 steps/day (as determined by Fitbits and other such devices), and climbing stairs regularly.  And the particular motions of the trains.</p>
<p>Another sense we experienced &#8211; sound.  Inasmuch as sounds were so much a part of our daily lives in the past two weeks yet relegated more to the background than the visuals, tastes and smells, I will take this opportunity to reflect upon and highlight some of the sounds of GPP&#8217;16.</p>
<p>Church bells.  One of the first things that we noticed is the regular ringing of the church bells.  They are ever-present in announcing the &#8220;time&#8221; in fifteen minute intervals &#8211; a special chime once for 15 minutes after the hour, twice for 30 minutes after, three for 45 minutes after and four at the top of the hour.  The hour is announced with a different bell chime and the numerical ringing for exact number appropriate for the time.  Although there are some variations and the timing for each church might vary slightly, the church bells are a constant of the sounds of Switzerland.</p>
<p>Trains.  Trains (and trams) are everywhere as well.  Given the Swiss trains &#8220;run on time&#8221; or at least mostly on time, we hear the trains passing by on a regular schedule.  The sound of the train varies by the type of train (e.g., local, regional, tilt train, fast train) and its destination.  There were also the cargo trains that sped rapidly through the train stations.  The differing sounds included the unique opening and closing of the doors which are dependent upon the train type &#8211; buzz or clicking type sounds and rolling out of the steps. Short whistles are blown when some trains are ready to depart as the conductor rushes onto the train.  Announcements are made in 4 or 5 languages (Swiss German, French, Italian, Romish, English).  And the sounds of the train stations themselves are like small cities with the hustle and bustle of shopping, eating and catching trains.</p>
<p>Sounds of the city (e.g., Zurich, Milan, Basel, Strasbourg) are similar to other large cities. The sounds produced by the trams, buses, cars and pedestrians (especially tourists) are abundant and contribute to the overall sound of the city and traffic.  Bicycle traffic is apparent and contributes mightily to intensity of people moving about the city.  Because the 2016 UEFA League Championship were held in Milan, this year the sounds were especially loud and focused on the upcoming finals and team rivalry.</p>
<p>Sounds in Riva San Vitale, Bellinzona and Lugano were less intense.  Sunrise (and even sunset) brought the sounds of birds and other natural events.  Rain and wind were common this year although the sounds varied with the extent of rain and the intensity of the wind. Sounds came from the lake and seemed to bounce from the mountain sides. Even the sunrise seemed to have a sound &#8211; a quiet unfolding of blue skies.  Early morning gatherings of local residents and their dogs were common.  Although I don&#8217;t understand Swiss Italian, there was pleasure in listening to the conversations of greeting and sharing among friends and neighbors. I felt as if I was allowed to ease-drop into the conversation and witness a moment without the disruption caused by outsiders.  (We don&#8217;t intend to disrupt but our presence changes the dynamic &#8211; another topic for the future is &#8220;ethical sightseeing&#8221;).</p>
<p>Throughout the trip, the differing accents, words and inflections associated with regional dialects and languages were fun to detect and try to understand.  When we listen carefully, the ways in which English was spoken helps us understand more about the native language of the speaker.  As part of our education, we must thank our colleagues for speaking English and listening to us try to speak their language.</p>
<p>Less obvious as &#8220;sound&#8221; perhaps were the sounds made by the GPP participants during our travels.  I can still hear conversations of participants as we walked toward a destination spanning at least two blocks.  Some voices carry more than others; some are not easily heard.  Others walked in silence, listening intently or saving our breath while ascending steps to ETH and UZh or Castlegrande in Bellinzona. Beyond the human voices, there were different sounds associated with walking on the cobblestones, rocks in the Villa&#8217;s garden and other types of pathways we encountered.</p>
<p>Our voices increased in volume and intensity as the trip unfolded and we became more connected and comfortable with each other.  It was very clear to outside observers that we were &#8220;tourists&#8221; traveling together although our purpose was not known. The volume of our voices revealed our enthusiasm and excitement about the trip (and perhaps the loudness of individuals from the U.S.).  The volume and intensity varied across the days depending upon our daily schedule and extent of our activities.  There were times when we became silent or slept.  I noticed this during times of fatigue and toward the end of the trip as the transition back to our &#8216;former&#8217; lives became more of a reality.</p>
<p>A sound highlight this year was music.  Many participants shared their musical talent. Throughout the trip, we would hear music from the keyboard played in the villa&#8217;s main room or a guitar played in the fireplace room, or a spontaneous chorus of voices during some of our excursions.  There were sing-alongs in the village after hours and serenades to our wonderful benefactor Lucy after dinner and the marvelous Director Daniela.  An original song entitled &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHwAAGEkl5A&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;a=">A rainy day in Riva San Vitale</a>&#8221; was composed and performed by Willie Caldwell.  Thanks.</p>
<p>It is somewhat difficult to capture the essence of sound in this blog but the sounds were real and provided wonderful additions to the experience.  In previous years, I have encouraged participants to observe the &#8220;windows and doors&#8221; and beyond.  Now I will add to &#8220;listen&#8221; carefully and to discover sounds that surround us. The GPP experience is truly about the sights and the sounds and much more.</p>


		<p>Recent world and national tragic events have prompted me to reflect on the responsibility of the Graduate School to reach out to those impacted by such events.  And the importance of doing so for the individuals as well as for the broader graduate community.</p>
<p>Graduate Schools tend to be places in which graduate students from many walks of life, social identities, nationalities, and cultural perspectives exist within the university.  A very diverse community which Graduate Deans should build to be more &#8220;inclusive&#8221; especially to counter the existing university culture of academic silos and lonely journeys through Graduate School.  An inclusive community which can be characterized by understanding and caring.</p>
<p>Although valuable throughout the graduate education journey, an understanding and caring community is especially important in times of tragic events, political uprising and natural disasters. When these happen, the experience and impact of these events vary depending upon the particular connection of the individuals to the event(s).  Not everyone responds in the same way or with the same emotions but the responses are real and deserved to be acknowledged.</p>
<p>Recent events within the past few months have definitely impacted the graduate community (and more) at Virginia Tech and beyond. Tragic events in Paris and Nice, Baton Rouge (2), Orlando, Minnesota and Dallas are but a few examples that have impacted the lives of VT graduate students and the communities with which they identify (e.g., black, gay, Hispanic, international, law enforcement and more).  Reaching out to individuals from these communities directly (e.g., email), statements of support and information sharing via social media, in-person gatherings, and dialogue sessions are strategies that we have used here under our <em>GLC Cares</em> program.</p>
<p>In addition to understanding the individual impact, it is very important to recognize the value of the &#8220;learning&#8221; (teachable) moments for others in the graduate community.  Even though the tragic events might be acknowledged within the university community, active engagement with the underlying issues (e.g., racism, terrorism) and impact upon individuals are often not.  As Graduate Deans, I believe that we should to take the opportunity to create a space to encourage meaningful and relevant dialogue about the issues and events to enhance our knowledge and understanding of the world.  In doing so, we can engage as global citizens in a world that so desperately needs greater cultural  understanding and the willingness to communicate.</p>
<p>It seems a simple thing to do to reach out and engage with graduate students.  It is and it&#8217;s so important.</p>


		<p>Shortly after his arrival at VT, President Timothy Sands established an initiative entitled <a href="http://www.beyondboundaries.vt.edu/index.html">Beyond Boundaries</a> and challenged the university to envision the future for Virginia Tech informed by four concepts: VT-shaped discovery, communities of discovery, nexus of discovery, and continuous innovation.  The key messages associated with Beyond Boundaries include the following (adapted from <a href="http://www.beyondboundaries.vt.edu">www.beyondboundaries.vt.edu</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>purpose driven and person centered approach</li>
<li>disciplinary depth and interdisciplinary capacities</li>
<li>flexible curricular design and research addressing complex needs of communities and society</li>
<li>land grant mission of outreach and application of knowledge with commitment to service through &#8220;Ut Prosim&#8221;</li>
<li>inclusive and diverse communities</li>

As shown in the figure, the &#8220;T&#8221; represents the disciplinary depth (3) as well as transdisciplinary knowledge (1).  The &#8220;V&#8221; represents the informal communal learning (2) and the guided experiential learning (4).  The graphic lends itself nicely to the VT symbol that has come to represent Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.</p>
<p>While much of the internal conversation has already focused on the undergraduate student, the concept applies to graduate (and professional) students. Specifically, &#8220;the challenges of the future require the capacity to work in interdisciplinary teams, engage in critical and creative thinking, collaborate with diverse people, communicate effectively, and conduct oneself with a deep sense of ethics.&#8221;  And indeed these &#8220;requirements&#8221; are key elements of the Graduate School&#8217;s initiative entitled <a href="http://graduateschool.vt.edu/gs/tge">Transformative Graduate Education</a> (TGE) developed in 2003.</p>

<p>As is shown in the figure and articulated on the website, the transformative graduate education (TGE) initiative &#8220;pushes the boundaries of traditional disciplinary academic education and provides the philosophical underpinnings for a truly innovative graduate education experience.&#8221;  TGE is framed by four cornerstones (pillars): knowledge, scholarly inquiry, leadership, and social responsibility.  Our efforts and activities are grounded within the fundamental principles of interdisciplinarity, inclusion and diversity, ethics, innovation (technology) and global perspectives.</p>
<p>Beyond the myriad of courses and programs offered, let me <a href="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-08-13-at-10.51.00-AM.png"><img data-attachment-id="1503" data-permalink="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2016/08/13/vt-shaped-individual-graduate-student-focus/screen-shot-2016-08-13-at-10-51-00-am/" data-orig-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-08-13-at-10.51.00-AM.png" data-orig-size="1364,1016" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Screen Shot 2016-08-13 at 10.51.00 AM" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-08-13-at-10.51.00-AM-300x223.png" data-large-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-08-13-at-10.51.00-AM-1024x763.png" class=" wp-image-1503 alignright" src="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-08-13-at-10.51.00-AM-150x150.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-08-13 at 10.51.00 AM" width="117" height="117" /></a>highlight a few examples of the ways in which the TGE initiatives contributes to the preparation of the VT-shaped graduate student as described above.</p>
<p>To address the &#8220;deep sense of ethics&#8221;, all graduate students must demonstrate understanding of academic integrity and satisfy an scholarly integrity and ethics requirement officially recorded on their graduate plan of study.  For more information, see <a href="http://graduateschool.vt.edu/academics/ethics">ethical pursuits</a> in academe and <a href="http://graduateschool.vt.edu/graduate_catalog/policies.htm?policy=ff80808147e9ba300147f3ee1b6e0002">ethics</a> requirement.</p>
<p>In order to help graduate students &#8220;communicate effectively&#8221;, the Graduate School offers a variety of approaches:  two graduate courses &#8211; Communication Science (2 cr) and Citizen Scholar Engagement (3 cr) and recognition as a <a href="http://graduateschool.vt.edu/gs/cse/engagement">Citizen Scholar</a>.  In addition, the Graduate School also offers a course entitled Inclusion and Diversity in a Global Society (3 cr) and actively promotes an affirming and welcoming graduate community and the Office of Recruitment and Diversity Initiatives (<a href="http://graduateschool.vt.edu/diversity">ORDI</a>).</p>
<p>The &#8220;T&#8221; educated individual stresses both disciplinary depth and interdisciplinary breadth and the VT Graduate School has actively engaged in developing initiatives and opportunities to foster interdisciplinary programs and interdisciplinary thinking.  Among these are the Interdisciplinary Graduate Education Programs (<a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/vtige/igep-program-overview/">IGEPs</a>), the development of the individualized interdisciplinary PhD program (<a href="http://graduateschool.vt.edu/graduate_catalog/program.htm?programID=individualInterdisciplinaryPhD_id">iPhD</a>) and support for the Interdisciplinary Honor Society (<a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/vtige/idr-honor-society/">IDR</a>) established by VT graduate students.  These are fine opportunities but it is time to extend beyond boundaries even more.</p>
<p>For many years, I have advocated for <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2015/08/06/interdisciplinary-thinking/">interdisciplinary thinking</a> and proposed the &#8220;pi&#8221; <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2014/10/27/i-t-and-pi-as-metaphors-for-graduate-education/">metaphor</a> for interdisciplinary or transdisciplinary graduate education.  <a href="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2012/03/Picture5.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="78" data-permalink="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2012/03/28/interdisciplinary-thinking-pi-and-adaptive-innovators/picture5/" data-orig-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2012/03/Picture5.jpg" data-orig-size="50,60" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Picture5" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2012/03/Picture5.jpg" data-large-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2012/03/Picture5.jpg" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-78" src="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2012/03/Picture5.jpg" alt="Picture5" width="50" height="60" /></a>In this graphic, disciplinary depth in more than one academic area is stressed and strong connections across the disciplines are emphasized depicting transdisciplinarity.  I would argue that expanding beyond the &#8220;T&#8221; to the Pi (π)-educated can be seen as a valuable approach in the preparation of graduate students to become the <a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2012/03/28/interdisciplinary-thinking-pi-and-adaptive-innovators/">adaptive innovators</a> needed for the 21st century workforce.</p>
<p>By adopting this philosophical approach in alignment with the VT Beyond Boundaries initiative, the goal of a VT-shaped graduate student can be realized not only through the opportunities to become Pi (π)-educated but also for graduate students to gain valuable knowledge, skills and abilities through the programs offered via the Graduate School&#8217;s Transformative Graduate Education (TGE) initiative.</p>

		<p>Sometimes there are individuals who by the nature of being oneself and moving forward make history and influence change. One such individual is Edward A. Bouchet, PhD (1852-1918).</p>
<p>Higher education in the United States prior to the early 1800s was accessible primarily to white males of some social and financial privilege.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_colleges_in_the_United_States">Women&#8217;s colleges</a> (e.g., <a href="https://home.oberlin.edu/">Oberlin</a>, 1837) would be founded in the early19th century.  Two <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/hq9511.html">HBCUs </a>(<a href="http://www.cheyney.edu/">Cheyney University of Pennsylvania</a>,1837; <a href="http://www.lincoln.edu/">Lincoln University</a> in Pennsylvania, 1854) were established for blacks before the American Civil War although the vast majority of the Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) were established post civil-war.  The <a href="http://www.aplu.org/about-us/history-of-aplu/what-is-a-land-grant-university/">Land Grant university</a> was developed in 1862 and shortly thereafter land grant universities were established throughout the United States including the addition of the 1890 HBCU institutions in the formerly segregated South.  As is evident above, very few individuals of color and women were provided access to seek higher education let alone an opportunity to earn a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) prior to the 1870s.  <a href="http://connecticuthistory.org/edward-alexander-bouchet-the-first-african-american-to-earn-a-phd-from-an-american-university/">Edward A. Bouchet</a> would change that history.</p>

<p>In 2005, Yale University and Howard University established the <a href="http://gsas.yale.edu/diversity/edward-bouchet-conference">Edward Alexander Bouchet Graduate Honor Societ</a>y (Bouchet Society) to recognize outstanding scholarly achievement and promotes diversity and excellence in doctoral education and the professoriate . As the co-founding chapters, <a href="http://gsas.yale.edu/diversity/edward-bouchet-conference">Yale University</a> and <a href="http://www.gs.howard.edu/bouchet/">Howard University</a> succeeded in honoring Dr. Bouchet’s pioneering contributions to doctoral education and established an ever increasing network of scholars and advocates for students who have been historically underrepresented in the professoriate. Since the founding, additional chapters have been established (Cornell University, Rutgers University, the Chicago School of Professional Psychology, the George Washington University, University of California, Los Angeles, University of California, San Diego, University of Miami, University of Michigan, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Washington University, St. Louis) and many deserving emerging scholars and faculty have been inducted to membership. At Virginia Tech, we are honored to have been recently invited to develop a <a href="http://graduateschool.vt.edu/Bouchet_Society">chapter </a>and induct VT PhD candidates as members.  This year, <a href="https://vtnews.vt.edu/articles/2016/09/president-sands-bouchet-society-award.html">VT President Timothy Sands</a> delivered the <a href="https://newsroom.howard.edu/newsroom/article/6496/timothy-sands-16th-president-virginia-tech-keynote-bouchet-forum">keynote address</a> at the 11th Annual Edward A. Bouchet Forum at Howard University and received the Legacy Award.</p>
<p>Edward Bouchet lived during a challenging time period for African Americans and he persevered. He expected much of himself and achieved even more. In addition to the Bouchet Graduate Honor society, his achievements and legacy are celebrated through numerous fellowships and awards such the Bouchet undergraduate fellowship at Yale, Promising Scholars fund, Bouchet Leadership award, American Physical Society Bouchet Award, and more.</p>
<p>Edward Bouchet served as a role model throughout his life and does so today. His legacy continues through the work of the Bouchet Society and especially the fellows selected annually by the chapters for their academic excellence, leadership, character, service and commitment to inclusion and diversity in the academy.  Challenges still exist today and there is much work to be done. The scholarship conducted by the Bouchet Fellows gives great value and meaning to society and their commitment to an inclusive academy helps continue the change that Bouchet started more than century ago.</p>


		<p><span class="tx">The issue of ethics&#8211;ethical choices, ethical decision-making, and ethical action&#8211;is a longstanding topic of concern for academics, both as scholars and teachers.  When we think </span>about ethics in higher education, we usually think first about scholarly integrity (e.g., plagiarism and scientific misconduct) and then perhaps codes of conduct and standards for professional behavior.  But there are additional aspects of ethics that should be discussed especially ethics associated with teaching and the ethics of service or engagement.  In this blog post, I will share briefly some musings about the ethics of service or engagement and scholar activism (e.g., scholar-advocate, citizen scholar).</p>
<p><span class="tx">Derrick Bell (2002<a href="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2015/04/Ethical-Ambition.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="1094" data-permalink="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2015/04/09/risk-taking-and-higher-education-not-an-oxymoron/ethical-ambition/" data-orig-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2015/04/Ethical-Ambition.jpg" data-orig-size="104,160" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Ethical Ambition" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2015/04/Ethical-Ambition.jpg" data-large-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2015/04/Ethical-Ambition.jpg" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1094" src="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2015/04/Ethical-Ambition-104x150.jpg" alt="Ethical Ambition" width="104" height="150" /></a>), author of </span><em><span class="tx">Ethical </span><span class="tx">Ambition: Living a Life of Meaning and </span></em><em><span class="tx">Worth</span></em><span class="tx">, wrote that </span><span class="tx f1172">“</span><span class="tx">ethics requires us to </span><span class="tx">think deeply about our positions on issues, </span><span class="tx">and to take principled stands as a result of </span><span class="tx">those positions</span><span class="tx f1172">” </span><span class="tx">(p. 50).  In this statement, Bell didn&#8217;t reference academia specifically but the application to those of us in higher education (faculty, administrators, students) should be clear.  There are many issues facing higher education in general (e.g., accessibility, affordability, student debt, relevance, null curriculum) in addition to matters that might arise within a discipline (e.g. controversial research topics, methodology), but &#8220;taking principled stands&#8221; is not necessarily something that has come easily or often to many of us in academe. On the other hand, there are disciplines (e.g., sociology, counseling, Ethnic studies) in which &#8220;taking principled stands&#8221; is common and perhaps even a foundation for scholarship and teaching/learning.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span class="tx">In addition to the research and teaching/learning missions of the university, &#8220;taking principled stands&#8221; also applies to the service mission of the land-grant university or more generally the social responsibility of the university.  At land-grant universities, we are quite familiar with the &#8220;service&#8221; or engagement mission and regularly have employees with strong ties to the community (e.g., extension agents, service learning).  In some disciplines, faculty who engage with society are identified as scholar-activist or scholar-advocate.  But faculty from most disciplines are not and wouldn&#8217;t necessarily identify as scholar-activist or advocates but faculty could take &#8220;principled stands&#8221; on issues.<br />

<p>Whether or not one identifies as scholar-activist (advocate or citizen scholar) directly, I believe those of us who work in higher education have an ethical responsibility to society. In our roles as faculty (and graduate students) or administrators we are often seen as an &#8220;expert&#8221; and having &#8220;expertise&#8221;.  And we are sometimes asked to share this expertise beyond academic circles and within the broader society. We need to respond to such requests but acknowledge that acceptance of these requests comes with additional responsibility; that of understanding the perceived and real power associated with being viewed as an expert and to understand the ways in which we can ethically interact and engage the public and with the public. It is a given that there are various ways to solve problems.  When sharing our expertise, it is also important to acknowledge the involvement of others with differing roles and associated responsibilities and explore how best to invite, interact and engage with others to share their expertise.  It is important that we do not intentionally or otherwise allow our academic expertise to silence others.  So where do we begin the process of thinking about &#8220;principled stands&#8221;, being intentional and taking action, and becoming citizen scholars or scholar activists?  Graduate School provides a good starting place.</p>
<p><span class="tx"> Through the Transformative Graduate Education (<a href="http://graduateschool.vt.edu/transformative-graduate-education-experience.html">TGE</a>) initiative offered by the VT Graduate School, graduate students have multiple opportunities to compliment their academic disciplinary degree and better prepare themselves for future and perhaps multiple careers. Two examples of many opportunities seem applicable here: Future Professoriate graduate certificate and Citizen Scholar engagement program.  Graduate students who wish to become future faculty gain knowledge and understanding about what it means to and to prepare to become faculty for 21st century universities through GRAD 5104 Future Professoriate course in which ethics and scholarly integrity are addressed.  In this class and in keeping with Bell&#8217;s premise above, we discuss what it means to think deeply about issues and to take principled stands as future faculty members.  In advocating for strong connections between academia and society, we have also developed a <a href="http://graduateschool.vt.edu/transformative-graduate-education-experience/citizen-scholar-engagement.html">citizen-scholar program</a> where graduate students can explore, learn and demonstrate their commitment to and be recognized for engagement with society.  These are relevant and fairly straightforward ways to encourage &#8220;ethical ambition&#8221; and &#8220;living a life of meaning and worth&#8221; as an integral part of graduate education.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span class="tx f1175">In <em>Ethical Ambition</em>, Bell (2002) offers some reflections and personal stories that can guide us toward success ethically. In particular he challenges us to &#8220;live a life of passion&#8221; and to have the courage to take the risks for what we believe in.  He shares the importance of community (family and friends) for &#8220;support in hard times&#8221;.  And he indicates that humility should be our watchword and that we should have &#8216;humility to know when our best intentions go awry&#8221;. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><span class="tx f1175">An &#8220;e</span><span class="tx">thical life is not a life of sacrifice; it is a life of </span><span class="tx">riches. The satisfaction of choosing ethically </span><span class="tx">enriches the fabric of our daily lives in ways we </span><span class="tx">might have otherwise thought impossible&#8221; (Bell, 2002).<br />

<p>Be thoughtful and intentional. Engage honestly and ethically with society.</p>


		<p>The Global Perspectives Program in Ecuador (GPP&#8217;16) occurred during the week of Thanksgiving break in November, 2016. This was the second year for graduate students to visit Ecuador in partnership between the VT Graduate School and the <a href="http://www.usfq.edu.ec/Paginas/Inicio.aspx">University of San Francisco de Quito</a>.  Most of us (7) were able to travel spend the week starting with a day long visit to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindo,_Ecuador">Mindo </a>Cloud Forest, comprehensive visits to two universities in Quito (USFQ and the National Polytechnica School or <a href="http://www.epn.edu.ec/">EPN</a>)  and to the Galapagos (<a href="https://www.usfq.edu.ec/galapagos/inicio/Paginas/default.aspx">USFQ-G</a>); one was able to extend her visit to <a href="http://www.usfq.edu.ec/programas_academicos/Tiputini/Paginas/About-us.aspx">Tiputini </a>in the rainforest of Ecuadorian Amazon.  The trip is documented through tweets via <a href="https://storify.com/VTGradCommunity/global-perspectives-program-in-ecuador-2016">storify </a>and will be shared in VT news story in January 2017.</p>
<p>As with other <a href="http://graduateschool.vt.edu/transformative-graduate-education-experience/future-professoriate/global-perspectives-program.html">GPP </a>programs, the Ecuador trip was indeed a very informative and enriching visit.  As intended, we learned about higher education in Ecuador from a public and private university perspective.  We gained knowledge and understanding about the environmental diversity of Ecuador including the cloud forest, Galapagos, Ecuadorian Amazon rainforest and life near the equator at 10,000 feet elevation.  We were introduced to the vast array of cultural diversity and rich history of Ecuador. GPP was once again a wonderful educational opportunity for professional development.  And as usual, opportunities for personal growth and development presented themselves throughout the trip.</p>
<p>Although this blog post was initially conceived as a posting about the Ecuador experience, the contemplation and writing are triggering reflections that extend beyond GPP16 Ecuador to the VT Graduate School <a href="http://graduateschool.vt.edu/transformative-graduate-education-experience/future-professoriate/global-perspectives-program.html">global perspectives program</a> (GPP) in general.  Yes, these trips are a<a href="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2016/12/Cx4ArnAW8AAmJgM.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="1663" data-permalink="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2016/12/18/global-perspectives-program16-ecuador-gpp16-reflections-beyond/cx4arnaw8aamjgm/" data-orig-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2016/12/Cx4ArnAW8AAmJgM.jpg" data-orig-size="1200,900" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Cx4ArnAW8AAmJgM" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2016/12/Cx4ArnAW8AAmJgM-300x225.jpg" data-large-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2016/12/Cx4ArnAW8AAmJgM-1024x768.jpg" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1663" src="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2016/12/Cx4ArnAW8AAmJgM-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>bout learning about higher education, visiting universities and cultural sites,interacting with university personnel (administrators, faculty, staff and students), sharing local food and beverages, and more.  It is about gaining knowledge and understanding and it is also about building relations and sharing time and space.  It is about professional and personal growth and development.</p>
<p>Based upon my experiences in leading the Global Perspectives Programs within the umbrella of the Transformative Graduate Education (<a href="http://graduateschool.vt.edu/transformative-graduate-education-experience/tge-initiative.html">TGE</a>) initiative,  I am convinced that it is possible to transcend and transform the typical graduate education experience in meaningful and significantly beneficial ways.  Graduate Deans can make a difference and should be engaged with the academic preparation and professional development of our graduate students as well as the personal growth and development important for life and work in the 21st century.</p>
<p>The experiences provided through the Global Perspectives programs for the past 12 years have allowed me to witness the development of strong connections between and among participants during each trip. (Note: the participants come from a variety of disciplines and usually do not know each other prior to the trip). Each GPP group tends to develop a special connection and bond which continues to evolve (visibly) across the days of the trip and exists well beyond.  And I am thankful for the opportunities to enhance my knowledge and learn something new every time.</p>
<p>This was the case for GPP&#8217;16 Ecuador.  We enjoyed our unique experience and shared some very special moments. As we came together from our different academic worlds and lived experiences, we spent time together, really listening and hearing each other, sharing stories and views and feeling &#8220;safe&#8221; enough to be brave in asking questions and engaging with difficult dialogues and challenging topics. Although not particularly articulated as outcomes, honesty and authenticity were anticipated and were realized.  The conversations were real.  There&#8217;s something to be said <a href="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2016/12/CyDlVa-WIAIAi8M.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="1664" data-permalink="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2016/12/18/global-perspectives-program16-ecuador-gpp16-reflections-beyond/cydlva-wiaiai8m/" data-orig-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2016/12/CyDlVa-WIAIAi8M.jpg" data-orig-size="1024,768" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="CyDlVa-WIAIAi8M" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2016/12/CyDlVa-WIAIAi8M-300x225.jpg" data-large-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2016/12/CyDlVa-WIAIAi8M-1024x768.jpg" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1664" src="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2016/12/CyDlVa-WIAIAi8M-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>about getting away from our daily (and typical) environments to sitting on a large balcony with a view of the ocean to stimulate conversation and communication. It is important to note that communication and connection occur not just as a result of conversation but occur in other ways. We were comfortable with silence as important in sharing time and space and connection. This become evident during our Ecuador experience. The connections were and are real.</p>
<p>Given the strength of our connection, we were able to engage in authentic discussions of serious topics which continued throughout the trip.  At one point, I was asked to describe the &#8220;whys&#8221; of the decision-making process for the GPP experiences. The question led me to reflect upon the intentionality of the process and the principles by which the experience evolves. There is reasoned and reasonable intentionality behind the logistics, sequence, the visits, expectations and anticipated outcomes. As a result of the question and conversation that followed, I have continued to examine the underlying philosophical underpinnings and the principles for the program. This is the easy part for these can be described. The more challenging part of the answer rests in the process of decision-making which unfolds organically, and mostly goes unnoticed, throughout the trip and lies at the essence of the GPP experience. It is this essence and genuineness that creates the long-lasting connections among the GPP participants.</p>
<p>Shortly after our return from GPP16 Ecuador, the Fall semester came to a close with graduate commencement ceremonies. This year like previous years, there were several graduates who have participated in the Global Perspectives Program (GPP) and are now not <a href="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2016/12/1465848464308.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="1670" data-permalink="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2016/12/18/global-perspectives-program16-ecuador-gpp16-reflections-beyond/attachment/1465848464308/" data-orig-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2016/12/1465848464308.jpg" data-orig-size="1024,695" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="1465848464308" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2016/12/1465848464308-300x204.jpg" data-large-file="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2016/12/1465848464308-1024x695.jpg" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-1670" src="https://gqcyy0ylcr0jgvhx-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/kpdtge/files/2016/12/1465848464308-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>only VT alumni but also GPP alumni.  As each one crossed the stage to receive their degree, we shared a moment in which the special connection of the GPP experience was present and very real.</p>


		<p>Fifty years ago, Robert F. Kennedy introduced the phrase that &#8220;one may live in interesting times&#8221;.  He stated that &#8220;l<span class="_Tgc">ike it or not, <b>we live in interesting times</b>. They are <b>times</b> of danger and uncertainty; but they are also the most creative of any time in the history&#8230;&#8221; (speech given in Cape Town, June 1966).  It appears to me that today, we are also living in &#8216;interesting times&#8217;.  For most, uncertainty and danger for many are clearly perceived for 2017 and beyond. There is so much that is unknown at the moment that it becomes unsettling. But perhaps these post-2016 election times might also challenge us, the words of RFK to be &#8220;creative&#8221;. That is, to ponder, reflect and act.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span class="_Tgc">In her book entitled <em>Hope in the Dark</em>, Rebecca Solnit (2015 reissue of 2004 book) writes  about &#8216;hope&#8217; but not as optimism per se but rather that &#8220;hope locates itself in the premises that we d</span><img class="alignleft" src="https://haymarket-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/000000/843/9781608465767-f_medium-2f1e8dbafb4b3334d0db297eed405179.jpg" alt="9781608465767-f_medium" width="125" height="184" /><span class="_Tgc">on’t know what will happen and that in the spaciousness of uncertainty is room to act. When you recognize uncertainty, you recognize that you may be able to influence the outcomes.” (from her <a href="https://www.facebook.com/rebecca.solnit/posts/10154521270090552">Facebook </a>page in November 2016).    </span>&#8220;Optimists think it will all be fine without our involvement; pessimists take the opposite position; both excuse themselves from acting. Hope is an embrace of the unknown and the unknowable, an alternative to the certainty of both optimists and pessimists. It’s the belief that what we do matters even though how and when it may matter, who and what it may impact, are not things you can know beforehand.&#8221;   As she proposes, recognizing uncertainty allows us to recognize that we might be &#8220;able to influence the outcomes&#8221;.  Thus, it appears that now is the time to take action.</p>
<p>Although a rather simplistic statement, the 2016 elections revealed so much more about the current state of U.S. society and higher education&#8217;s connection (or lack thereof) to that reality for many. Higher education has been often accused of being elitist and out of touch with society and I would argue that sometimes we have been. University towns are sometimes called a &#8216;blue bubble&#8217; in an otherwise red state. A recent article from the Chronicle of Higher Education highlighted the phenomena of &#8220;<a href="http://www.chronicle.com/article/Blue-Bubble-in-a-Red-State/238896?cid=wb&amp;utm_source=wb&amp;utm_medium=en&amp;elqTrackId=d7df41397f8e4f86be16834374718269&amp;elq=b0f6af0cd08f43ed820ccca0eccc1982&amp;elqaid=12159&amp;elqat=1&amp;elqCampaignId=4915">blue bubbles</a>&#8221;  and provided some perspective on why universities are sometimes isolated from the surrounding communities. And this is where change must begin.</p>
<p>From the perspective of higher education, I would argue (along with many others) that higher education has not only a role to play but a responsibility to get involved and even to assume a leadership role.  As educational institutions, colleges and universities must continue to educate our students as well as our faculty, staff and administrators about social justice, equity and civil discourse.  We must be intentional about engaging with the dialogue around difference, encouraging all to speak up and speak out and to do so by understanding difference and through listening and hearing the voices of others.  It is also important that we focus our attention to communicate with clarity and to enhance our skills and ability to determine the accuracy of information and seek truth.  Articles about programs, strategies and workshops as well as analyses, opinion pieces and reflections are found frequently in publications including the <em>Chronicle of Higher Education</em>, <em>InsideHigherEd, </em>and<em> Times Higher Education</em> to name only a few.</p>
<p>Let me offer a few examples.</p>
<p>In the days following the 2016 election, an increase in <a href="http://www.chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/heres-a-rundown-of-the-latest-campus-climate-incidents-since-trumps-election/115553">hate motivated campus-climate incidents</a> occurred and was reported by the Chronicle of Higher Education.  The data were compiled by Southern Poverty Law Center which issued a <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/20161129/ten-days-after-harassment-and-intimidation-aftermath-election">report </a>including historical context and detailed information about type and location of the hate-related incidents.  I believe that in part these data provided the impetus for the call for higher education to respond and a focus on citizenship was one such response. Although there are many others, recent articles suggest <a href="http://www.chronicle.com/article/How-Colleges-Can-Teach/238891?cid=gn&amp;utm_source=gn&amp;utm_medium=en&amp;elqTrackId=f184d42584d74ba596cc161d6cfe3998&amp;elq=0f4a11a9cb3e4e5e9d2afa47a617c500&amp;elqaid=12207&amp;elqat=1&amp;elqCampaignId=4945">how colleges can teach students to be good citizens</a> and urge colleges and universities <a href="http://www.chronicle.com/article/Don-t-Retreat-Teach/238923?cid=at&amp;utm_source=at&amp;utm_medium=en&amp;elqTrackId=24e030f1eaf944f6b01de5f18f24e176&amp;elq=0e3b85599df44e9abae4cd60c6d6e61d&amp;elqaid=12208&amp;elqat=1&amp;elqCampaignId=4946">not to retreat but rather to teach citizenship</a>.  Examples of programs and initiatives for understanding difference, increasing awareness of micro-aggressions and implicit bias and sustaining affirming campus-climate environment appear regularly in the higher education news and social media.</p>
<p>Given the rhetoric of the 2016 election campaign, it has become very clear that &#8220;racism still exists and can appear&#8221; on university campuses according to racial-equity scholar <a href="http://www.chronicle.com/article/A-Racial-Equity-Scholar/238843?cid=at&amp;utm_source=at&amp;utm_medium=en&amp;elqTrackId=ce21384a176045a995b99f9275a186ac&amp;elq=377562364dfb414ea6060ed342e69576&amp;elqaid=12042&amp;elqat=1&amp;elqCampaignId=4857">Harper </a>(2017) in a recent <a href="http://www.chronicle.com/article/A-Racial-Equity-Scholar/238843?cid=at&amp;utm_source=at&amp;utm_medium=en&amp;elqTrackId=ce21384a176045a995b99f9275a186ac&amp;elq=377562364dfb414ea6060ed342e69576&amp;elqaid=12042&amp;elqat=1&amp;elqCampaignId=4857">Chronicle of Higher Education article</a>.  &#8220;The polarizing nature of the 2016 campaign makes improving the racial climate a more urgent matter for higher-education leaders.&#8221;  Once again,this speaks to the opportunity and the need to act and educate.</p>
<p>Education is critical and universities must do their part.  Universities can provide opportunity, programs, space (real and metaphorical) for dialogue, and messages that foster inclusion.   A recent example of a timely message is the address provided by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u51wvuEL3-c&amp;feature=youtu.be">Andy Morikawa</a> (Blacksburg, Virginia) at the December 2016 Virginia Tech <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u51wvuEL3-c&amp;feature=youtu.be">Graduate School Commencement</a>.  (Note: his remarks begin at minute 35 on the recording).  Morikawa encouraged us to get involved, get engaged in civic life and community engagement, to be attentive, to listen, to have tough conversations with those who don&#8217;t share the same views and to do so regularly in community.</p>
<p>As we know education is a primary mission of higher education and for many universities, research is also a primary mission.  Science, discovery and the search for truth are critical and remain even more so in the post 2016 election era.  Besides &#8216;teaching citizenship&#8217; and encouraging civil discourse, how do we engage our students with determining facts and uncovering &#8216;fake news&#8217;?  A recent article from Times Higher Education (THE) suggests that it is <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/blog/fake-news-solution-education-not-regulation">education not regulation</a>.  Seargeant and Tagg (2016)  wrote that &#8220;the heightened need for critical literacy skills in tackling fake news and media manipulation highlights the central role that higher education can play for society as a whole.&#8221;  Further, Virgo (2017) writing in Times Higher education suggests that the university must accept its “<a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/comment/university-critic-and-conscience-society">role as critic and conscience of society</a>”.</p>
<p>In this post-2016 election era, faculty and academic administrators have much to contemplate not only about our defined missions in research, teaching, and engagement but also as critic and conscience of society in accepting the responsibility of the university as a social institution and to do so with &#8220;<a href="https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/kpdtge/index.php/2016/10/28/intentional-and-ethical-scholar-activism/">intentional and ethical scholar activism</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>Higher education has the responsibility to be &#8216;creative&#8217; and innovative in these &#8216;interesting times&#8217; and to embrace the unknown and act so we can &#8216;influence the outcomes&#8217;.  Let us work individually as well as collectively.</p>
